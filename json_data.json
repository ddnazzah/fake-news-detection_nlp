Her comments -- which came at the beginning of a lengthy speech about improving economic opportunities for disabled Americans -- marked her first on-camera remarks on the shootings, which have again sparked a debate about lethal police force.\n\n\"There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,\" Clinton said. \"It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.\"\n\nThe Democratic nominee added: \"I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.\"\n\nEven as she referred to the deaths as \"two very upsetting incidents,\" Clinton also urged the public against channeling their anger by targeting police officers as she pointed to the protests that unfolded Tuesday night.\n\nRead More",

Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore.\n\nThe latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%. The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the \u201ctoss up state\u201d category.\n\nDonald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia. Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump, Trump\u2019s childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum. The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program. Lower income families will also benefit from the plan\u2019s offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year. Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns. Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parent\u2019s expenses including in home nursing and long-term care. Finally, Trump\u2019s childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parent\u2019s decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent.\n\nDonald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New York\u2019s most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. Trump\u2019s excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course, Trump\u2019s unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health following her fainting at last week\u2019s September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion of Trump\u2019s health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women. So yes, somehow all this concern about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump.\n\nTrump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something \u201cunpresidential\u201d. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could \u201cmess up his hair\u201d. While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned, the fact that Trump said \u201cyes\u201d to the display speaks volumes. He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the \u201cTrump Train\u201d. Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his. However small, it\u2019s another check mark in the honesty and transparency box.\n\nNow if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients. Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed \u201ctwo years early and under budget\u201d, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the \u201cbirther issue\u201d. Trump took the microphone and said \u201cNot to mention her in the same breath,\u201d (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) \u201cHillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.\u201d Trump said.\n\nOnce again, political correctness be damned, Donald Trump has had another \u201camazing week.\u201d\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

Why lie about it? Unless playing the \u2018foreigner\u2019 card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of \u2026 whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.\n\nBecause if That WASN\u2019T a lie\u2026 then something else MUST be. That \u2018something else\u2019 being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.\n\nThe quote can be read in context at Breitbart.",

        "text": "Less than a day after protests over the police killing of an African-American man turned violent in North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs.\n\n\"If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,\" said Trump in a speech to the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh today.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon. Officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. One person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound.\n\nThe Republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity.\n\n\"Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities? We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.\"\n\nHe continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training.\n\n\"It's tough being a police officer,\" Trump said. \"Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always \u2014 and it will be by them \u2014 vigorously addressed.\"\n\nBut aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, Trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against African-Americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. They cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black Americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill African-Americans, in many instances unarmed.\n\nTrump in recent days has appealed to black Americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime.\n\nDuring a rally earlier this week in North Carolina, Trump said, \"We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,\"\n\nMany African-Americans have bristled at that broad assertion. While many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black Americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. A Pew report released in December shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. And according to the Census Bureau, almost 73 percent of black Americans do not live in poverty.\n\nTrump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited Cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. And during a town hall on the Fox News Channel Wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence.\n\n\"I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to,\" said Trump. \"We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.\"\n\nBut this morning in an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" he stepped back from the statement, claiming he was referring to a strategy only for Chicago.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Trump delineated a difference between what he called the \"violent disruptor\" and the rest of the black community. He said it was the country\"s job \"to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations.\"",

        "text": "Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed \u201cwatered-down\u201d HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and \u201clikely increased\u201d the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nThe congressional report, titled,\u201cThe Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,\u201d was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.\n\nThe congressional report focused on Clinton\u2019s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.\n\nIt also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.\n\nRanbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.\n\nThe Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation\u2019s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,\u201d said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.\n\n\u201cWhen companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA\u2019s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,\u201d said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.\n\nThe Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, \u201calleged due to the company\u2019s diluted drugs, it \u2018subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,\u2019\u201d according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe question becomes, \u2018how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,\u2019\u201d asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.\n\nThe possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nBlackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nThe congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation\u2019s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.\n\nIt is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the \u201cwatered-down\u201d drugs.\n\nProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered \u201cmore than $1.8 million packages.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,\u201d Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.\n\nThakur told TheDCNF that many of the company\u2019s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.\n\n\u201cThese drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,\u201d he said.\n\nRanbaxy\u2019s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.\n\nThe FDA sent a public \u201cwarning letter\u201d to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company\u2019s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, \u201cshow much lower potencies in these batches.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ranbaxy\u2019s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company\u2019s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.\n\nBill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.\n\nNeither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.\n\nThakur said he\u2019s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on \u201caccess\u201d to patients.\n\nThe whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. \u201cI have tried to reach out to them,\u201d he told TheDCNF. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nCHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.\n\nCharles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was \u201cdeeply suspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called \u2018CHAI\u2019 was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,\u201d Ortel told TheDCNF.\n\nThe congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.\n\nHe signed an executive order that, \u201crelaxed intellectual property policy standards,\u201d promising the U.S. government \u201cwould not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any \u2018Sub-Saharan country\u2019 relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,\u201d the report states.\n\nCHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nCHAI\u2019s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief \u2014 a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton\u2019s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become \u201cgood acquisition targets,\u201d according to the study.\n\nRanbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.\n\nThe companies enjoyed great financial profits and they \u201cexploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.\n\nOne relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.\n\nRajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.\n\nVinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.\n\nBlackburn says the worst part of the story were the \u201cfalse hopes\u201d offered by the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\u201cYou think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients.

        "text": "Getty Images Wealth Of Nations Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works He sees it as zero-sum. She believes all boats rise together. Hillary is right, but a lot of people are buying into Trump\u2019s vision.\n\nAs he made clear once again in Monday night\u2019s debate, Donald Trump sees the world in zero-sum terms\u2014when one person or one country wins, another always loses. Asked by NBC\u2019s Lester Holt how to help American workers, Trump responded in his usual way, saying America was getting beaten by everyone else around the world, and the NAFTA free-trade deal was \u201cone of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. ... We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton, by contrast, sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at once\u2014as she also made plain Monday by harking back to Bill Clinton\u2019s pro-globalization presidency, which included NAFTA. \u2018I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,\u201d she said. \u201cIncomes went up for everybody.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence. \u201cMy whole life is about winning. \u2026 I always win,\u201d Trump says in explaining why he\u2019s running. The economic plan on his website begins with the rubric \u201cWinning the Global Competition.\u201d You don\u2019t get more zero-sum than that.\n\nDespite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zero-sum game\u2014but rather a complex mechanism that, if run right, can raise everyone\u2019s welfare at once\u2013Trump\u2019s message has resonated in an era when it\u2019s become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy. The zero-sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades. As Danny Vinik recently noted in Politico, the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow.\n\nThe recent Census Report that showed a 5.2 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an America in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed. Statistically, if the United States is one unit, that is true. But 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences ill-suited to one size fit all numbers, and while the averages and medians may go up or down, that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number. And the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid-2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative, insecure and economically grim.\n\nHence, you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the Democrats, while those who think they\u2019ve lost are going toward Trump. There is some truth there, but that isn\u2019t a sufficient explanation for why, for instance, massive percentages of African-Americans and Latinos, who have certainly struggled economically and socially, support Clinton.\n\nNo, what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero-sum terms, like Trump, and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of \u201cwinners\u201d without creating a commensurate number of losers. That has been the mantra of Clinton and her predecessors in the Democratic Party, and it was also the foundation of Ronald Reagan\u2019s appeal. The belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier.\n\nHillary Clinton has continued to deliver that message. At the Democratic Convention in July she spoke of an America thriving with economic opportunity, with millions working hard and succeeding. President Obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of Silicon Valley, the revival of many cities in the past decade, and the substantial gains on the other side of 2008-2009 financial crisis. Judging from polls and surveys, those who fit that description \u2013 clustered and concentrated in large metro areas, and on the coasts especially \u2013 support Clinton and the Democrats by wide margins.\n\n***\n\nIs either side right? Most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billion-strong global middle class. In general, that view is correct. But it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the United States caught in the vortex of rapid change. It does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents. They legitimately fear that they will lose those homes, be unable to afford healthcare, that they will see their communities crumble and their children\u2019s hopes extinguished. And they see a world of others who appear to be doing better, who seem to be winning, and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing.\n\nThe voice of the so-called losers in this global competition is as loud, politically speaking, as it\u2019s been in a long time. Hence Trump (not to mention Bernie Sanders\u2019 powerful insurgency in the Democratic primaries). The last time so many in the United States were so sour about the inequities between those winning (the few) and those losing was at the dawn of the Progressive Movement in the 1890s. Many early Progressives rebelled against an elite vision of Social Darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can. In 1896, the scion of that view was William Jennings Bryan, who painted a picture of the United States every bit as bleak and dark as Trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a \u201ccross of gold.\u201d Bryan lost two elections, and his zero-sum view never came to dominate American politics. Much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system, however, was taken up by Theodore Roosevelt and generations of both Republicans and Democrats. Some of it harsh and redistributive, focused on trust busting and exerting American influence and prestige abroad, and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all.\n\nTrump also enjoys a good deal of sub-rosa support among business leaders and Wall Street, who certainly haven\u2019t lack for economic benefits in today\u2019s world. They aren\u2019t supporting him with their money, but many of them detest Clinton and see Trump as expressing their world view. For Wall Street, that makes some sense, in that in the wake of the financial crisis, key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable. In that sense, finance, which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid-1980s through the mid-2000s, has been losing ground. The idea of gain and loss, and that every trade represents a winner and a loser, is deeply embedded in aspects of Wall Street.\n\nWe have, of course, no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks. But if Trump wins, he should remember: it is impossible to find any society and any point in American history where a zero-sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security. Zero-sum most often begets zero-sum, whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars. By contrast, the profound strength of the United States has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero-sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have. A vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers, and little else.\n\nZachary Karabell is head of global strategy at Envestnet and author of The Leading Indicators: A Short History of the Numbers That Rule Our World.

        "text": "Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He\u2019s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cdrug dealers\u201d from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a \u201ctemporary measure.\u201d He\u2019s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:\n\n\u201cThe other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don\u2019t kid yourself. When they say they don\u2019t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.\u201d\n\nBut he\u2019s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald\u2019s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism \u2014 he\u2019s fighting the \u201cnarratives\u201d of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump\u2019s \u201cnarrative\u201d is \u201ckill them all\u201d:\n\nLast weekend\u2019s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama\u2019s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we\u2019re in more than a fight about \u2018narratives\u2019 \u2013 these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.\n\nPay attention to that last bit: \u201cThey must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.\u201d\n\nNow, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating \u201cterrorists?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re protecting each other, but they\u2019re really doing very bad damage \u2014 they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,\u201d Trump said in March. \u201cWhen they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that\u2019s a big problem.\u201d\n\nIf Muslims are \u201cprotecting\u201d terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump\u2019s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists\u2019 families. How would he define terrorism?\n\nThese are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself \u2014 but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents\u2019 security to \u201csee what happens\u201d to them (shortly after suggesting that \u201cSecond Amendment People\u201d could deal with them. We\u2019re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the \u2018little red button\u2019 that launches our nuclear arsenal.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen \u2014 one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.\n\nNormally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He\u2019s said it himself. Many times.\n\nIf we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation \u2014 to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it\u2019s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.\n\nFeatured image via Getty Images/Joe Raedle",

I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.\u201d\n\nThe veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after Congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override.\n\nSuffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. By comparison, former President George W. Bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted.\n\nThe last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nIf passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages.\n\nObama and the White House have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of \u201csovereign immunity,\u201d and put the U.S. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries.\n\n\"Overriding the president's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up U.S. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained to reporters today.\n\n\"Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world.\"\n\nBut the showdown has also put the Obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven't had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks. Saudi Arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists.\n\nThe House and Senate each passed the measure by unanimous consent. A veto override requires a two-thirds vote by each chamber, and the White House says it has been working diligently behind the scenes to rally enough Democrats to block the override effort.\n\nObama's former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, has also indicated she would sign the legislation into law if she wins the presidential election.",

Protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. Shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. That\u2019s not a protest; it\u2019s a riot. And it doesn\u2019t endear anyone to the Black Lives Matter cause. It makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. That doesn\u2019t fix anything.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. It\u2019s shameful to see the Black Lives Matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. Instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. They encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. How they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension.",

        "text": "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs.\n\nThe two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers.\n\nHere are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate:\n\n1. Nominees Started Off on a Friendly Note but No Escaping the Sarcasm\n\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface.\n\nWhen Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents\u2019 trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, \u201cHow are you, Donald?\u201d Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting.\n\nShortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, \u201cBut in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,\u201d before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, \u201cYes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.\u201d\n\nHe seemed to be referring to his addressing her as \u201cSecretary Clinton,\u201d although it wasn\u2019t completely clear during the moment.\n\n2. Personal Attacks Came Early\n\nClinton was first to go on the attack during tonight\u2019s debate, taking aim at Trump\u2019s business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business.\n\n\u201cDonald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience,\u201d Clinton said, before expanding on her father\u2019s work as a drapery maker.\n\nTrump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in \u201ctrumped up, trickle-down\u201d economics.\n\n\u201cFor one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,\u201d Trump said.\n\n3. Trading Barbs Over Trade\n\nVoters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\n\nTrump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim.\n\n\u201cAnd now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nClinton fired back, \u201cWell, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.\u201d\n\nTrump then pointed to Clinton\u2019s once referring to TPP as the \u201cgold standard of trade deals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, \"TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\u201d Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that \u201cwhat I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.\u201d\n\n4. Trump Asks \u2018Why Not\u2019 Blame All the World\u2019s Problems on Clinton\n\nLess than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: \"I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t miss a beat, saying to his opponent: \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nClinton responded: \"Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this\u2014\u201c\n\nTrump interjected: \"There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,\u201d before the moderator reminded Trump, \"This is secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.\"\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\n5. Trump Hit Over Not Releasing Tax Returns\n\nTrump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns.\n\n\u201cI don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it will be released,\u201d he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general.\n\nTrump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. \u201cI will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,\u201d she said. \u201cYou got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns?\n\n\u201cMaybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,\u201d she said.\n\n6. The Birther Issue Gets on the Main Stage\n\nModerator Lester Holt asked Trump \u201cwhat took you so long\u201d to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republican nominee\u2019s recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years.\n\nAt first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was \u201csatisfied\u201d with when Obama released his birth certificate.\n\nHolt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions about it\u2019s authenticity until 2015.\n\n\u201cNobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,\u201d Trump said, referencing the years between the release and Trump\u2019s decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. \u201cI figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.\u201d\n\nPaul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images\n\n7. Clinton Defends Being \u2018Prepared\u2019 When Trump Questions Her Time Off the Trail\n\nTrump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's OK,\u201d seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight\u2019s faceoff.\n\n\"I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,\u201d Clinton said. \"And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.\u201d\n\nThroughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance.\n\n8. Stop and Frisk Becomes a Big Point of Discussion\n\nTrump\u2019s support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate.\n\n\u201cStop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that \u201cit went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would have won an appeal,\u201d he said, noting that there was no appeal.\n\nTrump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.\n\n9. Trump and the Iraq War Under the Microscope\n\nToward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started.\n\n\u201cI did not support the war in Iraq,\u201d Trump said. \"That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.\u201d\n\nHolt corrected him, saying, \u201cThe record shows otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, \u201cAre you for invading Iraq?\"\n\nTrump appeared to hesitate, responding, \u201cYeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201d\n\nDespite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, \u201cThe record shows that I am right.\u201d\n\n10. Sparring Over Stamina\n\nHolt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a \u201cpresidential look,\u201d asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her \u201cstamina.\u201d\n\n\"She doesn't have the look, she doesn\u2019t have the stamina,\u201d Trump said. \"I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.\u201d\n\nTrump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down.\n\n\"Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nShe also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women:\n\n\"One thing Lester, he tried to switch from looks to stamina,\u201d Clinton said. \"But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs. And someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers. Who has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.\u201d",

The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they\u2019re an organization for good.\n\nThe Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:\n\nJust 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization\u2019s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and \u201cother expenses.\u201d The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization\u2019s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as \u201cother expenses,\u201d while the remaining almost $851K was marked as \u201cprofessional fundraising expenses.\u201d Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more \u201cother expenses\u201d in 2014.\n\nSometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money.

And I never felt this way until now and I can\u2019t stand how we\u2019re treated,\u201d the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears.\n\nDavid T.

We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,\u201d she said.\n\nZianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted \"no justice, no peace\" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in North Carolina\u2019s most populous city since the shooting.\n\nProtests started on the streets of Charlotte after news of Scott's shooting broke last Tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week.\n\nDavid T. Foster III/The Charlotte Observer via AP Photo\n\nThe scene grew especially tense Wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a Hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees.\n\nAt the city council meeting, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. At several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and Police Chief Kerr Putney.\n\nAfter the meeting wrapped up, The Charlotte Observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the Government Center.\n\n\u201cRelease.

But it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by Scott's wife, Rakeiya Scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege.

CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton\u2019s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups \u2013 these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low \u2013 would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a \u201cminor setback\u201d to her \u201cinevitable\u201d victory.\n\nThe American people aren\u2019t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d dismissals. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cmild cold,\u201d er, \u201cseasonal allergies,\u201d I mean \u201cheat exhaustion,\u201d that is to say \u201cminor case of pneumonia\u201d is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a \u201cmystery man\u201d who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable \u201cepisodes\u201d (or otherwise freezes up with a brain \u201cshort-circuit\u201d during a speech).\n\nThis guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.\n\nBlue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has \u201cpneumonia\u201d required a neurological squeeze test?).\n\nThe Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won\u2019t, but they should. I wonder what official \u201cdiagnosis\u201d we\u2019ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they\u2019ve been there a hundred times before. \u201cNothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton\u2019s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she \u2018powered through\u2019 yesterday going door-to-door.\u201d\n\nThe point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She\u2019s proven, yet again, that she can\u2019t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She\u2019s a liar. That\u2019s her default mode. She\u2019s corrupt. And she\u2019s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else \u2013 including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.\n\nDo I take joy in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. \u201cDo not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice\u201d (Proverbs 24:17).\n\nIndeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters as a \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cirredeemable\u201d \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d has only served to accelerate the plunge.\n\nPerhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement \u2013 especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her \u201cfriend and mentor.\u201d Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags \u2013 the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.\n\nWho\u2019s the racist?\n\nI\u2019m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can\u2019t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.\n\nIt\u2019s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she\u2019s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she\u2019s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, \u201cMany are the plans in a person\u2019s heart, but it is the LORD\u2019s purpose that prevails.\u201d\n\nAm I saying there\u2019s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there\u2019s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.\n\nStill, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton\u2019s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector \u2013 a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.\n\nWhen they visit her in prison.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

        "text": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is making one plea ahead of Monday night\u2019s big debate: Don\u2019t let Donald Trump get away with it.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s campaign is firing right back, arguing that the press is biased against the Republican nominee and, in any case, Clinton\u2019s team is just trying to \u201cgame the refs.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening White House race, with Trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground-state surveys. Polling averages now show that Clinton\u2019s post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a \u201cdead heat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. State firewall breaking up. Trend lines awful,\u201d Silver tweeted.\n\nDuring the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at Hofstra University, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with Clinton\u2019s aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt fact-check Trump in real time.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,\u201d Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies, \u201cthat that simply be checked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. What bothers us, Mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs,\" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBC.\n\nBut Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending Trump\u2019s claim that Holt may be unfair to him because he\u2019s a Democrat and the system is \u201cvery unfair.\u201d The \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that he knew what Lester Holt\u2019s voter registration was,\u201d said Conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied. \u201cHe didn\u2019t lie,\u201d Conway said at one point, explaining that \u201ca lie would mean that he knew the man\u2019s party registration.\u201d\n\nIn a presidential cycle that\u2019s seen endless debates about debates, Monday\u2019s theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. After suggesting a debate with no moderator, Trump has already signaled to Holt that he shouldn\u2019t try to be Candy Crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a fact-check of the GOP nominee.\n\nBut Clinton\u2019s campaign has beat up on Holt\u2019s NBC colleague Matt Lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing Trump\u2019s false assertion that he didn\u2019t support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month.\n\nView One week of Hillary Clinton fact-checks (September 24, 2016) One week of Hillary Clinton fact-checks (September 24, 2016)\n\nThe nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in Sunday. \u201cIn our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,\u201d Janet Brown, the commission\u2019s executive director, told CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to fact-checking, Brown warned, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Clinton won\u2019t let Trump\u2019s lies \u201cgo by the wayside,\u201d press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday, insisting that Holt shouldn\u2019t, either.\n\n\u201cThere is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,\u201d he said. \u201cLester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too, but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates\u2019 performances should take it into account. By now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. If he says them again, that should be disqualifying. He can\u2019t possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.\u201d\n\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern.\n\n\u201cI think what the concern is from both of the campaigns \u2014 and what it should be \u2014 is that the moderator is not the person who\u2019s running for president of the United States. So I think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can hold people accountable, there\u2019s no question, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so they\u2019re making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign, including his former aide Lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic. That charge was leveled in response to the Clinton camp\u2019s preparation for two Trumps.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want Donald Trump\u2019s lies and distortions to be a distraction. We\u2019re hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,\u201d Mook told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday.\u201d\n\nAsked about Clinton\u2019s rules of engagement versus Trump, Mook added that \u201cit just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate, and we just don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\nView One week of Donald Trump fact-checks (September 24, 2016) One week of Donald Trump fact-checks (September 24, 2016)\n\nBut Conway shot down the notion that there\u2019s any other Trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is \u201cto become human\u201d during the debate, senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that \u201cOverprogramming leads to short circuits,\u201d and Conway joined the pile-on.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be robotic and scripted. Hillary Clinton is,\u201d Conway said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that haven\u2019t been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.\u201d\n\nAfter Mook warned against \u201ca double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,\u201d Conway added that the two campaign managers \u201care living in parallel universes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying it\u2019s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is fact-checked in real-time,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot. Yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experience hasn\u2019t necessarily been beneficial.\u201d\n\nAside from how Holt will moderate, Conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was Clinton\u2019s willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they\u2019re conclusions in search of evidence,\u201d Conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debate.\n\n\u201cWhat I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. These are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter,\u201d Conway said. \u201cNinety-two percent of at least two of our embeds\u2019 tweets are negative towards Donald Trump. Why are they on our campaign plane? Why are they covering our campaign? ... Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like we can\u2019t get a fair shake from certain people.\u201d\n\nConway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogul\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cSo if she ends up saying to him, \u2018That\u2019s just not true, you\u2019re distorting my record, you\u2019re being mean to a woman,\u2019 and then people will say, \u2018He was mean to a woman,\u2019 and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up \u2014 even if it\u2019s not true,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that would be my concern, that he\u2019s not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe [Scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that she\u2019s not a great debater, that she\u2019s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she\u2019s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.\u201d\n\nRudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate, said he had advised Trump to \"just let loose\" and be himself \u2014 and not try to compete with Clinton's detailed policy expertise.\n\n\"She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,\" Giuliani said on \"Fox and Friends.\" \"So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be \u2014 he's just going to be like you see him on \u2014 when he comes here [on Fox News] and when you talk to him on the phone. He's going to be Donald Trump.\"\n\nAuthors:",

        "text": "I\u2019ve watched every presidential debate ever broadcast, including the little-remembered John F. Kennedy-Hubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years I've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump, I\u2019m pretty much baffled.\n\nThe problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (Will Trump be low-key and calm? Will he attack her honesty? Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) The problem is that almost all of Hillary Clinton\u2019s strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknesses\u2014especially her vast experience in government. The more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of: \u201cYou\u2019ve been at the center of power for 25 years? Then you\u2019re one of those who\u2019s created the mess we\u2019re in.\u201d So reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with Trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIndeed, this debate offers Trump the chance to perform what I\u2019ve called \u201cpolitical judo\u201d\u2014turning an opponent\u2019s strength against her. (\u201cYes, Mrs. Clinton, your experience helped drag us into Iraq, and turned Syria, Libya, the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS. Maybe that\u2019s why your husband's CIA director, and Bobby Kennedy\u2019s chief speechwriter, are backing me.\u201d)\n\nFurther, there's a sense\u2014a highly limited sense\u2014in which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980. Among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, \u201cI'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.\u201d It's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter, but needed reassurance about Reagan, which they got. (There is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter was).\n\nBy contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of \u201chonest and trustworthy\u201d? If Trump can be convinced by his handlers\u2014assuming they exist\u2014to avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said. She can of course cite chapter and verse on Trump\u2014bankruptcies, Trump University, David Farenthold's expose of his charities in the Washington Post\u2014but those issues are ill-suited, I think, to a face-to-face debate. One of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at Trump\u2014and he's still standing.\n\nDoes any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night? No. It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and don\u2019t do, based on a half-century or so of history.\n\nThe Focus Is on \u201cMoments\u201d\u2014But They\u2019re Not Always The Key\n\nAsk any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this:\n\n\u201cNixon looked pale and drawn; Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control; Reagan said to Carter \u2018there you go again,\u2019 then asked Americans \u2018are you better off?\u2019 Four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about Mondale\u2019s \u2018youth and inexperience.\u2019 Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wife\u2019s rape and murder. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. George H.W. Bush looked at his watch. Al Gore stalked George W. Bush, who froze him with a nod.\u201d\n\nThese are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. It\u2019s why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lines\u2014\u201czingers\u201d\u2014to win the attention and admiration of the audience. (It\u2019s also why the late political journalist Lars Erik-Nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, \u201cYou\u2019ve all become theater critics.\u201d)\n\nBut in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. Sometimes, it\u2019s the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. Look back at the first Romney-Obama debate in 2012. There was no one exchange, no one Obama stumble or Romney answer, that provided the \u201daha!\u201d moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. It was, rather, Obama\u2019s petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the president\u2019s most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten.\n\nThe presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a \u201cmoment\u201d unlike any in debate history; that\u2019s clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: \u201che seemed pretty reasonable\u201d or \u201cshe knows what she\u2019s talking about and he doesn\u2019t.\u201d This has special relevance for Clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide Patti Solis-Doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. A sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionable.\n\nThere Are Three Debates, Not One\u2014And That Can Matter A Whole Lot\n\nOne key reason why the 1980 Reagan-Carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. Carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate John Anderson, so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st. When the independent fell below the polling threshold, Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October 28th\u2014barely a week before the election.\n\nEvery other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. That\u2019s what happened with Reagan in 1984, and with George W. Bush in 2004; it\u2019s also what happened last time out, when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetings.\n\nHere, I think, is an opening for Clinton\u2014especially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a question\u2014and they are usually very lame \"what can you do for my daughter?\" questions\u2014into answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of Trump\u2019s astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore, who challenged Bush\u2019s commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: \"What about Dingell-Norwood?\" The opportunity for her is to argue\u2014from experience\u2014that what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (Further, the Town Meeting format\u2014with dozens of \u201creal\u201d people as participants\u2014makes the resort to personal insults highly risky).\n\nTrump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political Judo\n\nThe potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. It came in 1992, when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthey've got a point. I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.\u201d\n\nJudo, however, can cut both ways. There\u2019s a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success.\n\n\u201cWell, you might be successful, Donald, but we really don\u2019t know because you\u2019re the first presidential candidate ever who won\u2019t show us his taxes. But you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: Mike Bloomberg, who\u2019s worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didn\u2019t start with millions from his father, says you\u2019re a con, a fake. So does Marc Cuban, who built his success from the ground up. But I do have to admit\u2014you\u2019re way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.\u201d\n\nDebates Are NOT Decisive\n\nOne last note. It\u2019s easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night. A lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (\u201cReagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.\u201d \u201cObama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected\u2026\u201d). But is correlation really causation? Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in Obama\u2019s clear if modest popular vote victory.\n\nIn their influential 2013 book, The Gamble, political scientists John H. Sides and Lynn Vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other \u201cgame-changers\u201d with real-time public opinion measurements. What they found was that even a dramatic event like Romney\u2019s first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. Compared to the \u201cfundamentals\u201d\u2014economic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarized electorate\u2014the stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance.\n\nOf course, this cycle the \u201cfundamentals\u201d point to a very close race. So you\u2019ll probably want to tune in anyway\n\nJeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author.",

        "text": "After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter\u2019s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton\u2019s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.\n\nThe different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.\n\nAside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary\u2019s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.\n\nSince the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.\n\nThe question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?\n\nWhat we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.\n\nIt is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.\n\nIf anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.\n\nThe American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it\u2019s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton\u2019s schedule.\n\nInteresting fact\u2026.I just searched Hillary Clinton\u2019s rally events scheduled between September 20 \u2013 October 19 \u2013 She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn\u2019t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!\n\nThere are many questions about her health, and admittedly I\u2019m no expert. However I am a realist.\n\nI recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton\u2019s left hand.\n\nI further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.\n\nFurther rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn\u2019t appear to want to be president any longer.\n\nNo matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.\n\nAs for Hillary Clinton\u2019s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won\u2019t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the \u201cconspirators.\u201d\n\nWorse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats.

Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the party\u2019s nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be here next week. We\u2019re probably going to have some downtime,\u201d Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason we couldn\u2019t vote.\u201d\n\nDemocratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter.\n\nIn the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right!\n\nBut America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on Romney\u2019s taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the Democrat\u2019s numerous public statements. According to The Hill:\n\nMinority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is \u201cethically compromised\u201d and the \u201cking of the welfare kings.\u201d\n\nIronically, Romney\u2019s father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief.\n\nAmerican voters deserve to know what\u2019s inside Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

        "text": "It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn\u2019t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he\u2019d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.\r\n\r\nFirst, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn\u2019t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals\u2019 butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn\u2019t. He peeked into people\u2019s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns\u2019 desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?\r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music \u2014 the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans \u2014 and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they\u2019d seen. (\u201cHey, bro, it\u2019s the president!\u201d \u201cYeah, bro!\u201d) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word \u201cISIS\u201d came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He\u2019d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.\r\n\r\nAt first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn\u2019t kidding. \u201cI want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,\u201d he\u2019d tell them. They\u2019d laugh and say something like, \u201cHey, Mr. President, please don\u2019t ever say that again publicly!\u201d Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.\r\n\r\nThey were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other\u2019s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, \u201cIs it about how you\u2019re really a terrorist?\u201d He looked at her and said, \u201cYes, actually.\u201d She stopped eating her Popsicle. \u201cDonald Trump was right about you?\u201d He nodded. \u201cAbout everything.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He\u2019d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (\u201cHonestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.\u201d) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?\u201d Hillary asked. Obama nodded. \u201cKind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.\u201d\r\n\r\nNo one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn\u2019t know what had given it away. He\u2019d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? \u201cWait, what?\u201d Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo\u2019s eyes were really tiny LED screens. \u201cDid you know that when Bo barks,\u201d Obama said, \u201che\u2019s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?\u201d\r\n\r\nHillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. \u201cYou\u2019re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?\u201d Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m short-circuiting!\u201d Obama did his best to comfort her. \u201cBo does that sometimes. Then he\u2019ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.\u201d\r\n\r\nHillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman\u2019s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. \u201cI\u2019m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,\u201d Hillary apologized. \u201cDo you mean a fin?\u201d Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: \u201cBut I haven\u2019t even told you the best part yet. I\u2019m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsis?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, ISIS. All caps.\u201d\r\n\r\nHillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn\u2019t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he\u2019d be. He told her \u201clike for real\u201d they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nHe was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll wait until I\u2019m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.\u201d Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn\u2019t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to \u201cWonderwall\u201d as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair. Pretty soon, it was morning again.",

One of the most famous is probably \u201cread my lips\u2026no new taxes,\u201d a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:\n\n.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend\u2019s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO \u2014 Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016\n\nTake a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn\u2019t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. \u201cDestroy\u201d doesn\u2019t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty \u201cyeeeeehaw,\u201d the reality is that he\u2019s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He\u2019s talking about profiling Muslims. He\u2019s talking about Donald Trump\u2019s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn\u2019t just a Muslim, he\u2019s an\n\nThe man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn\u2019t just a Muslim, he\u2019s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he\u2019s a suspect in a bombing doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked \u201ckill\u201d and not on the most wanted list. There\u2019s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.\n\nWhat that means is that under Trump\u2019s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I\u2019m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn\u2019t about the narrative. It isn\u2019t about prevention or education.\n\nIt\u2019s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.\n\nThe only solace we have is that what he\u2019s promising is nothing but another \u201cread my lips.\u201d Terrorism isn\u2019t something you can simply \u201cdestroy\u201d just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn\u2019t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.\n\nFeatured image from file",

They didn't ask her about, you know, much,\u201d Trump said on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d \u201cBut I was asked about my tax returns, which I've told about 500 times. But, you know, I think I did \u2014 I think I really did well when we were asked normal questions. I think I did really well in answering those questions, but those questions are not answerable in a positive light.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nStill, Trump was upbeat overall about the debate, which he said \u201cwent really well\u201d despite \u201csome hostile questions.\u201d The Manhattan billionaire gave Holt a C+ for his performance as moderator, praising him for his issue-based questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trump\u2019s real estate company in the 1970s, even though it was Clinton who brought up the Justice Department lawsuit.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think he did a bad job. You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther, he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat's a beauty to be asked, you know, 40-year-old lawsuit, or older. I just hate to say it\u2019s older because then you\u2019ll know, then [Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt] will say \u201c\u2019Wow I didn\u2019t know Trump was that old.\u2019 Hey, she\u2019ll be unimpressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cHe didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there's no question about it. He didn't ask about her foundation.\u201d\n\nAttacking Holt became a running theme from Trump's campaign Tuesday morning, as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator.\n\n\"I was disappointed that Lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy \u2013 the FBI investigation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in Benghazi and Libya \u2013 that never came up,\" GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Good Morning America.\n\nTrump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took a similar line, saying on CNN Tuesday that there were topics she wished Holt would have raised.\n\n\u201cI just would have liked to have heard more about Benghazi or e-mails or the Clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news,\" she said. \"You know, one of our guests last night was Mark Geist, not Mark Cuban, Mark Geist, who's a Benghazi hero and survivor. And You know, he was within several feet or yards of them and I think it's a good reminder to be Americans of what her record is on that particular issue.\"\n\nWhile the Republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed Clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. Trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with.\n\n\u201cI had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. I don\u2019t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cMy microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn't exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.\u201d\n\nAsked if Clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, Trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who Trump called \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and \u201cMiss Housekeeping\u201d because of her Latin heritage. Addressing Trump directly about the name-calling, Clinton said, \u201cDonald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November.\"\n\n\u201cI know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother Teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.\u201d\n\nAuthors:",

        "text": "One Critically Wounded As Charlotte Police Endure Second Night Of RIOTS\u2026 [VIDEO]\n\nIn a second night of violent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black police officer shot and killed an armed, black suspect, Keith Lamont Scott, things are spiraling out of control and the governor has declared an emergency there. One protester is clinging to life by a thread after being critically wounded by a protester who shot into the crowd randomly. He was hit in the head and is on life support.\n\nThree other protesters and four officers were wounded in the chaos. I even heard that protesters tried to throw a reporter into a fire. I also saw white people in their cars with guns for protection. I can\u2019t say that I blame them. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and many other businesses were hit by vandals during all of this. The National Guard has now arrived to help fight the increasing violence in Charlotte.\n\nFrom the Daily Mail:\n\nNational Guard troops have arrived in Charlotte after a protest turned violent on Wednesday night. A state of emergency has been declared in response to the chaos that has taken over the North Carolina city, two days after a father-of-seven was shot dead by a police officer. One of the demonstrators was shot in the head outside the Omni Hotel and is fighting for his life. At least three other protesters and four police officers were also taken to hospital after they were injured in the riot. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV were also attacked while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. It was the second night of unrest following the deadly shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by black cop, Brentley Vinson, on Tuesday afternoon. Police insist he was armed, but family members maintain he was only reading a book when he was gunned down next to his car. Many businesses and buildings, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame, were hit by vandals and looters. Major companies with offices in the downtown area \u2013 including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy \u2013 all told employees to stay away from the area Thursday. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering putting a curfew in place in a bid to control the disorder.\n\nA number of black people defended the police officers, but there were far more that wanted to get their violence on there. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV was attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast.\n\nOn Thursday morning, hotel and restaurant employees and security guards started cleaning up dozens of broken windows after protesters smashed buildings and painted the slogan \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 on walls. Demonstrators were also seen breaking into a convenience store and a shop that sells merchandise for the NBA franchise, the Charlotte Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans. Some protesters expressed anger at the lawlessness exhibited by fellow demonstrators. One woman was heard shouting, \u201cStop \u2013 that\u2019s not what this is about,\u201d as young men broke bottles in the street.\n\nAfter a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants.\n\nA riot is an uncontrollable beast\u2026 once you unleash it, it takes on a life of its own and the message is usually lost in the violence and chaos that ensues. I fear this is another step in a race war and all out chaos in our streets. Russia must be smiling.\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com",

The National Democratic Party, a \u201cpowerful hate group,\u201d has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.\n\n[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America\u2019s Most Powerful HATE Group\n\nAs a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author\u2019s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get \u201cHillary the Horrible\u201d into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.\n\nA proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone \u2013 especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President \u2013 to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.\n\nThe proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters \u2013 but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens \u2013 to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.\n\nDue to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.\n\nDonald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America\u2019s most powerful \u201cHate Group,\u201d not only wants \u201cHillary the Horrible\u201d to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.\n\nLet us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

Here\u2019s what he said:\n\n\u201cBefore going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country. And it seems to be a never-ending problem. America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness, that has not only gotten us through our toughest times \u2013 because we\u2019ve had some tough times \u2013 but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.\n\n\u201cEveryday I see people of different backgrounds working together for common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation, united by shared values and principles as American citizens. We have to do it. And we have to respect our flag. We have to respect our flag.\n\n\u201cWe all have to walk a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country.

We have to do that.\n\n\u201cThere is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration.\n\n\u201cOur job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and get their children great educations. We have to cherish and protect those people.\u201d\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

        "text": "A Daisy of a Rerun\n\nI am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.\n\nThe year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson \u201capproved\u201d that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly \u201cwar mongering\u201d opponent, Barry Goldwater.\n\nToday, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson\u2019s deceitful war policies, Goldwater\u2019s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation\u2019s media.\n\nI mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.\n\nObviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a \u201cDaisy\u201d remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.\n\nSomehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater\u2019s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.\n\nInstead, today\u2019s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as \u201cnews and views.\u201d With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media\u2019s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.\n\nNow, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted\u2019s \u201cdramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.\u201d This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a \u201cpathological liar\u201d and \u201cutterly amoral.\u201d\n\nAs the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of \u201c\u2019Lyin Ted,\u2019 insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.\u201d These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.\n\nSchools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?\n\nAnother safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say \u201cderogatory\u201d when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the \u201cliberal press\u201d moniker has now everyday acceptance.\n\nIt is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public\u2019s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.\n\nAlso, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.\n\nThese quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.\n\nWith that, consider the President\u2019s past considerations of today\u2019s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, \u201cShe will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can\u2019t be trusted and isn\u2019t qualified to be President.\u201d\n\nObviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it\u2019s damning, given the time frame.\n\nAlso during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: \u201cIf you can\u2019t run your own house, you certainly can\u2019t run the White House.\u201d\n\nApparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.\n\nAgain, wouldn\u2019t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

        "text": "\"Donald, you\u2019re a sniveling coward,\" Ted Cruz said in March. | Getty 9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him\n\nTwo months after he was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention for snubbing his party\u2019s presidential nominee, Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday.\n\nThat declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the Texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly \u2014 in part responding to Trump\u2019s attacks on his wife and father.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n1. Early on, Cruz speculated that Trump\u2019s tax returns could show a mob connection\n\nIn February, Cruz offered his take on why Trump hadn\u2019t released his tax returns in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d suggesting that they might show \u201cDonald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that there\u2019s a bombshell there,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt\u2019s natural to wonder, \u2018Well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes?\u2019\u201d\n\n2. In March, Cruz called him a \u201csniveling coward\u201d\n\nSpeaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to \u201cspill the beans\u201d on the senator\u2019s wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, \u201cDonald, you\u2019re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to tick me off. I don\u2019t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that\u2019ll do it every time,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n3. He also called Trump a \u201cbig, loud New York bully\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds,\u201d Cruz said . \u201cIt is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.\u201d\n\n4. Also, \u201ca small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks, Cruz suggested , were actions of \u201ca small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.\u201d\n\n5. Cruz called one of Trump\u2019s theories \u201cnuts\u201d and \u201cjust kooky\u201d\n\nIn May, after Trump cited a National Enquirer report that alleged Cruz\u2019s father may have had some involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: \u201cThis morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, let\u2019s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.\u201d\n\n6. He also called him a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who \u201clies practically every word that comes out of his mouth\u201d\n\nAlso in Indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added : \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. He doesn\u2019t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.\u201d\n\n7. And Cruz was specific with the term \u201cpathological\u201d: Trump is \u201cutterly amoral,\u201d he said\n\n\u201cI say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he\u2019d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he\u2019s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,\u201d Cruz said .\n\n8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a \u201cserial philanderer\u201d\n\nContinuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered : \u201cHe combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don\u2019t think this country\u2019s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, \u2018Dude, what\u2019s your problem?\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd: \u201cDonald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. This is not a secret. He\u2019s proud of being a serial philanderer.\u201d\n\n9. In July, Cruz still hadn\u2019t forgiven Trump for the attacks on his family\n\n\u201cI am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,\u201d Cruz said, answering questions at a Texas delegation breakfast at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing Trump.\n\nReferring to his pledge to support his party\u2019s nominee, Cruz said that statement \u201cwas not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack Heidi I'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog\" and support him.\n\nAuthors:",

We can \u2014 you know, we can take it, no matter who wins.\u2019 No. The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years, and I say that absolutely seriously.\u201d\n\nThe former secretary of state said she hopes everyone is registered to vote and directed listeners to a website to find out whether they\u2019re registered \u201cbecause I need you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe gotta stand up and be counted in this election,\u201d she added.\n\nClinton\u2019s comments come after President Barack Obama made an appeal on Clinton's and his own behalf in an address to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation on Saturday.\n\n\u201cMy name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,\u201d Obama said. \u201cTolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that\u2019s on the ballot right now.\u201d\n\nBut up next on the docket is the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday in New York, where the former senator expects to absorb a bunch of body blows from an aggressive foe.\n\n\u201cI am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we\u2019ve seen coming from my opponent,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I\u2019ve been at this and, you know, I understand it\u2019s a contact sport.\u201d\n\nWhat Clinton won\u2019t take, though, is any insults toward anyone else. \u201cYou know, his attacks on African-Americans and immigrants and Muslims and women and people with disabilities, it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s just something we cannot tolerate,\u201d she said.\n\nAs Clinton wrapped up her interview, Trump taunted her on Twitter: \u201cHillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest.

He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.\r\n\r\nThe attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.\r\n\r\nThe attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.\r\n\r\nDahir Adan\r\nDahir Adan\r\nSt. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.\r\n\r\nAdan\u2019s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.\r\n\r\nMembers and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist\u2019s family.\r\n\r\nThe Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an \u201caccomplished student\u201d in high school (but of course).\r\n\r\n\r\nJason Falconer\r\nOfficer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department\r\nSt. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who \u201chappened to be in the right place at the right time.\u201d\r\n\r\nFalconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That\u2019s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.\r\nOfficer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.\r\n\r\nLast year the Washington Times reported that Obama\u2019s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.\r\n\r\nThe Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.\r\n\r\n\u201cTHIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.\r\n\r\nIn May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.\r\n\r\n\u201cPRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTHEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN \u2013 WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,\u201d HE SAID.\r\n\r\nIn June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.\r\n\r\nIn July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.\r\n\r\nU.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years\r\n\r\nIf Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.\r\n\r\nBreitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It\u2019s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nMen & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.\r\n\r\nHillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.\r\n\r\nA vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.\r\n\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\nFrom Freedom Daily",

        "text": "I was a Democrat all my life. I came to Washington to serve President John Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. When the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own, I joined his Senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter, until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination. I ran on a (losing) Democratic ticket in the New York state elections of 1970. When I was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-Governor Bill Clinton was chairman of my National Committee for the Police Corps.\n\nThis year, I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSo profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision.\n\nHere it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. But today\u2019s Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. We have American military bases in 80 countries, and there are now American military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. Generals and admirals announce our national policies. Theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. Our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action.\n\nNor has the Democratic Party candidate for president this year, Hillary Clinton, sought peace. Instead she has pushed America into successive invasions, successive efforts at \u201cregime change.\u201d She has sought to prevent Americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by characterizing him as \u201canother Hitler.\u201d She proclaims herself ready to invade Syria immediately after taking the oath of office. Her shadow War Cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, in Ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. And the Democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with Russia, for example by sending American warships into the Black Sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to Russia itself.\n\nIn fact, in all the years of the so-called War on Terror, only one potential American president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that America cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees that America\u2019s natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. Only one American candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with Russia and China, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking.\n\nThat candidate is Donald Trump. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election.\n\nIt must also be said: Mr. Trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. He is crude, often vulgar. He has areas of great ignorance. He insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. He would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. He is often intemperate; though it is not Trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare Putin\u2019s moves in Ukraine to what Hitler did\u2014an insult that throughout all the Cold War and to this day, no American president has ever offered to any Soviet or Russian leader, not even the enormous butcher Josef Stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the Second World War. And it is not Mr. Trump but Michael Morell, a former CIA director now high in the councils of the Democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin \u201ckilling Russians,\u201d a doubly illegal act of war.\n\nMoreover Trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the Washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-American for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war.\n\n***\n\nJohn Kennedy admired political courage. He began his first campaign for Congress at the height of the Cold War by saying, \u201cAbove all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. We must not have another war.\u201d Years later, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the Soviet Union: there were 13 men in the ExComm room, and Robert Kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war.\n\nBut within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, President Kennedy had forged a close working relationship with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic American University speech of 1963. Our \u201cstrategy of peace,\u201d he said, was \u201cnot a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.\u201d Rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that \u201cour most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children\u2019s future. And we are all mortal.\u201d As to our great adversary the Soviet Union, he said, \u201cwe must reexamine our own attitude\u2014as individuals and as a nation\u2014for our attitude is as essential as theirs.\u201d\n\nSix months later he was dead; and it was Robert Kennedy who must resume the effort. Robert Kennedy made ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the early centerpiece of his Senate career. But as President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam, it was that war which forced Robert Kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. Wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world.\n\n\u201cOur brave young men,\u201d he said, \u201care dying in the swamps of Southeast Asia. Which of them might have written a poem? Which of them might have cured cancer? Which of them might have played in a World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? Which of them would have taught a child to read? It is our responsibility to let these men live ... It is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.\u201d\n\nHe also urged that we consider the Vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. He demanded of his colleagues, on the Senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of God, the rule of life and death over others. \u201cAll this is our responsibility,\u201d he said, \u201cnot just a nation\u2019s responsibility but yours and mine.\u201d\n\nJohn and Robert Kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. But they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. Both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death.\n\nThe legacy of JFK & RFK is \u201cbeing abandoned by today\u2019s Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nTheirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by today\u2019s Democratic Party. We have broken one Middle Eastern nation after another. Hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of ISIS, Al Qaeda, or Islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. They cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in Libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. They cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example Turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the Kurds). So a Democratic administration, carrying on the work of the Bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder.\n\nScores of Democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in Vietnam. Today there is only the voice of the marvelous Democratic member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to Iraq and knows of what she speaks. And it is a Democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to see America\u2019s unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations.\n\nMost amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten Europe, threaten the United States, threaten Western civilization itself\u2014as we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat.\n\nWhere are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? Why to Russia, which the U.S. general who commands NATO has announced is the prime \u201cexistential\u201d threat to America. As you read this, ground, air and naval forces of NATO, led and largely paid for by the United States, have been moving about the Western borders of Russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since World War II. At the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the South China Sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of China, our second said to be \u201cexistential\u201d enemy.\n\nThere are no Russian terrorists ravaging France or Italy or America. ISIS is not to be found on Russian soil. The only Russian terrorists who have attacked the West are the Islamists whom President Putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. The only Chinese terrorists are Uighurs who are attacking not us but China itself. It would seem elementary common sense that America would have long since sought, not to fight with Russia and China, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the ISIS that is terrorizing Europe today.\n\nFormer Defense Secretary William Perry, a Democrat, warns that we are now, today, \u201con the threshold of a new Cold War. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the Cold War.\u201d\n\nSurely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by America, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. The years of constant combat have exhausted our military. False hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. Our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade.\n\nBut, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. The dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. This is not a danger imported from Syria or Iraq or Russia. Our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day.\n\nFor the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. And now we can see the result. The violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. The money we squandered on bombs in Iraq was not available for our own schools. The brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. They were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. They were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the American Constitution to the least among us. They were not here to protect American cities and enrich American lives.\n\nAnd they were not here to keep Americans and American children from murdering American police officers. This is our true present danger.\n\n***\n\nSo my hope for America is this. First, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. We need our best young people to help us here at home. We need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. We need to breathe free again.\n\nWe must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. ISIS and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. But we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. We must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. We must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially Russia and China.\n\nPresident Kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with Russia and the Russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, Ronald Reagan said the same. Fools in Washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. But it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our children\u2019s future.\n\nSecond, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. There are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted.\n\nBut nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the Constitution itself. Our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. We need many more and better police. We need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. We need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by IEDs in Afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit and Baton Rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land.\n\nDonald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, \u201cAmerica first.\u201d But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond.\n\nFinally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. Of course we do not hope for domestic discord. But the people of the United States have perhaps stood silent for too long. The elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. These are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. This president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, \u201cThere can be no business as usual with Russia.\u201d\n\nSurely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. We simply cannot fight the entire world, Russia and China and all the nations of the Mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time.\n\nAnd therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as Washington, as Jefferson, as Lincoln, as Martin Luther King:\n\nReturn to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the Union, but sought no foreign conquests.\n\nDo not step over the threshold of a new Cold War, a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization.\n\nCommit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations.\n\nThis, as I understand it, is the platform of Donald Trump. It was not the Republican Party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. But it is his platform. It is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. It is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest Americans of all parties.\n\nWell may we seek reassurance whether Mr. Trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. No one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. But Trump has given some evidence. He set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about America than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. And yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. Perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both.\n\nFlawed as he may be, Trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. Most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. Thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. You and I will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as Lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations.\n\nTruly, America first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. These are the reasons why I will vote for Donald Trump for president.\n\nAdam Walinsky worked in the Department of Justice during the Kennedy administration and later served as legislative assistant and speechwriter to Sen.

Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and \u2018selective enforcement\u2019 based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with \u2018baseless\u2019 tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: \u2018Muslims don\u2019t belong here\u2019. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.\n\nNo, you\u2019re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.\n\nMayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. \u201cIt was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,\u201d Bollwage said, adding, \u201cIt had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.\u201d\n\nRahami\u2019s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken.

        "text": "For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don\u2019t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we\u2019ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was \u201cPapa\u201d John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees\u2019 hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn\u2019t.\n\nThis year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn\u2019t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s. Here\u2019s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:\n\nJudging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that\u2019s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn\u2019t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:\n\n\u201cI want to try it,\u201d CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. \u201cWe could have a restaurant that\u2019s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.\u201d \u201cWith government driving up the cost of labor, it\u2019s driving down the number of jobs,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.\u201d \u201cThis is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,\u201d says Puzder. \u201cDoes it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?\u201d Source: Yahoo Finance\n\nThis threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He\u2019s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.\n\nPuzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.\n\nPuzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don\u2019t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.\n\nYou can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That\u2019s just the way he is: profits over people.",

        "text": "The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton\u2019s top aide Huma Abedin.\r\n\r\nApparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained \u201ctens of thousands of e-mails\u201d from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary\u2019s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.\r\n\r\nOn July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed \u201cdismay,\u201d and \u201cdisgust\u201d with Director Comey\u2019s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.\r\n\r\nA high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, \u201cIt was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton\u2019s] security clearance yanked.\u201d\r\n\u201cIt is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,\u201d the senior FBI official told Fox News. \u201cWe were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said \u2018but we are doing nothing,\u2019 which made no sense to us.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aFox News\r\nUPDATE October 17, 2016:\r\nThe FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official \u201cpressured\u201d the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton\u2019s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.\r\n\r\nThe FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called \u201cThe Shadow Government\u201d who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that \u201cplaced Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for \u2018her election campaign\u2019\u201d.\u200a\u2014\u200aBBC News\r\n\r\nUPDATE October 25, 2016:\r\nAccording to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official\u2019s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server.\r\n\r\nUncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta\r\nIn September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user \u201cstonetear\u201d, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton\u2019s private e-mail server.\r\n\r\nMr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.\r\n\r\nWikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016\r\nOn March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:\r\n\r\nFrom:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015\u201303\u201304 20:41 Subject: Special Category\r\nThink we should hold emails to and from potus?

They may not care, but I seems like they will.\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545\r\nIn other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton\u2019s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.\r\n\r\nUPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up\r\nOn March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton\u2019s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official\u2019s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server.\r\n\r\nFwd: POTUS on HRC emails\r\nFrom:cheryl.mills@gmail.com To: john.podesta@gmail.com Date: 2015\u201303\u201307 21:41 Subject: Fwd: POTUS on HRC emails\r\nwe need to clean this up\u200a\u2014\u200ahe has emails from her\u200a\u2014\u200athey do not say state.gov\r\n\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014 Forwarded message\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\r\nBegin forwarded message: *From:* Josh Schwerin <joshschwerin@gmail.com> *Date:* March 7, 2015 at 6:33:44 PM EST *To:* Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>, Kristina Schake < kristinakschake@gmail.com>, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>, Jesse Ferguson <jfferg@gmail.com> *Subject:* *POTUS on HRC emails*\r\nhttps://twitter.com/katherinemiller/status/574350749280432129/photo/1 Jen you probably have more on this but it looks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news.\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/31077#efmAABABT\r\nUPDATE October 20, 2016: Podesta E-mails Release 13 Confirms President Obama Knew Of Clinton\u2019s Private E-mail Server\r\nOn Mar 8, 2015, at 7:56 AM, Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com<mailto:jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>> wrote:\r\nThey know POTUS and HRC emailed. Josh has been asked about that. Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm. I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinet\u2019s email addresses.\r\nOn Mar 8, 2015, at 12:40 AM, Philippe Reines <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\r\nI find it odd the NYT didn\u2019t actually quote the President saying what\u2019s in their headline. Especially since the story has a disbelieving tone to his not noticing. One of us should connect with the WH just so they know that the email will show his statement to not make sense. I\u2019m happy to do so to Josh Earnest since Jen is in a weird position, unless Cheryl or John you want to (or already have) with someone else. But it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that Josh is going to get asked how this was possible, and he should have the factset. Especially if it\u2019s some weird technical thing with the President\u2019s email setup that he doesn\u2019t see addresses.\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/21779\r\nTo make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.\r\n\r\nI know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren\u2019t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I\u2019ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc.\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099\r\nThe reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.\r\n\r\nHowever, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.\r\n\r\nThis suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President\u2019s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.\r\n\r\nWhen you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.\r\n\r\nTimeline of Events:\r\nMarch 2, 2015: The New York Times breaks the story that Clinton used a personal e-mail account while Secretary of State.\r\nMarch 4, 2015: The Benghazi committee issues a subpoena requiring preservation of all e-mails.\r\nMarch 7, 2015: Barack Obama states he only learned about the private e-mail server \u201cthrough news reports\u201d at the same time as everybody.\r\nMarch 7, 2015: 15:41:16 -0800 (PST) Cheryl Mills writes EMAIL ID 31077 as revealed by Podesta Emails Part 18: \u201cwe need to clean this up\u200a\u2014\u200ahe has emails from her\u200a\u2014\u200athey do not say state.gov.\u201d\r\nMarch 7, 2015: Hillary Surrogate Terry McCauliffe met with the FBI agent who oversaw the Clinton e-mail case and his wife and promised financial support ($500k+) if she ran for office.\u200a\u2014\u200aWall Street Journal\r\nMarch, 25\u201331, 2015: Paul Cobetta, a Platte River Networks employee, permanently and irreversibly deletes the email archive using a software called BleachBit likely under orders from Cheryl Mills after receiving advice on Reddit on how to delete e-mails for a \u201cVIP\u201d.

My great grandparents did not.\u201d\n\nThe issue of Trump\u2019s support for the birther movement was raised late in Monday night\u2019s presidential debate by moderator Lester Holt, who asked Trump what he would say to Americans hurt by his championing of the issue. As he did at a press conference two weeks ago, Trump blamed Hillary Clinton and her associates for first raising the issue and took credit for bringing the matter to rest. To those who might have been offended, the Manhattan billionaire said \u201cWell, I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate].\u201d\n\nBrazile admitted that the apology she wants from Trump is \u201cnot forthcoming, so I know I'm speaking into the wild darkness of Donald Trump, but I think he should be ashamed of himself to bring that up and to say -- and this is what he said, \u2018I'm the one who got him to produce the birth certificate.\u2019 It's amazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it's a shame we put the president of the United States through this. It's just awful. And every time we talk about it, it's the wound. It\u2019s the wound that won't heal,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is what Donald Trump should understand, it's the wound that will never heal as long as people go out there and exploit what I call real racial pain and animus in this country.\u201d\n\nAuthors:",

In fact, it\u2019s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.\n\nThis is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises\u2026 because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton\u2026 EVER.\n\nFrom Bearing Arms:\n\nWe told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn\u2019t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.\n\nFalconer\u2019s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.\n\nThe 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer\u2019s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.\n\nClinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers \u201cimmunity.\u201d It\u2019s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.\n\nJason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.",

        "text": "978 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nI don\u2019t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton\u2019s health constantly making headline, but it\u2019s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.\n\nHere are the top takeaways from the poll:\n\n\u2022More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either \u201cbelow average\u201d or \u201cvery poor\u201d health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That\u2019s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.\n\n\u2022The share of voters who think Clinton\u2019s health is \u201caverage\u201d remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either \u201cabove average\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).\n\n\u2022Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton\u2019s potential medical issues.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she\u2019s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60\u2019s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually \u2018looking old\u2019 or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can\u2019t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary\u2019s health. The suspicion isn\u2019t from one particular thing, it\u2019s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.\n\nAt one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady\u2019s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting \u2018confused and needing naps\u2019, of which she was probably severely punished.\n\nAnd then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn\u2019t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.\n\n\n\nAnother of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.\n\n\n\nThen there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone\u2019s arm.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don\u2019t see her in person because she looks awful.\n\n\n\nAnd of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she\u2019s gasping for air. It\u2019s incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next *Cough Cough HmHmm Uck Khoff Khak Khak Gack \u2014 *GASP excuse me, President of the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,\n\n\u201cIf I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.\u201d\n\nThese comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin\u2019s Sunday elections. She also said,\n\n\u201cIf I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.\u201d\n\nShe took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.\n\nThe results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.\n\nRegardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.\n\nHowever, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.\n\nMerkel stated,\n\n\u201cIf people don\u2019t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany\u2019s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.\u201d\n\nChristian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,\n\n\u201cIt is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.\u201d\n\nThe growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain\u2019t broke don\u2019t fix it.\n\nThis could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama\u2019s and Hillary Clinton\u2019s. She is no different which is why many Americans too cannot stand her.",

Allegedly, the school has been mandating children profess the Islamic statement of faith, memorize the five pillars of Islam, as well as teaching students that the Muslims faith is stronger than a Christian or Jews. This is all according to lawsuit filed in federal court this past Wednesday.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of John and Melissa Wood with the Thomas More Law Center and the action is being taken against La Plata High School in Maryland. According to John Wood the school banished him from their property when he complained about the Islamic teachings.\n\nRichard Thompson, President of Thomas More, said,\n\n\u201cDefendants forced Wood\u2019s daughter to disparage her Christian faith by reciting the Shahada, and acknowledging Mohammed as her spiritual leader.\u201d\n\nThe Law Center commented that for non Muslims such as Christians and Jews that reciting the Shahada Islamic creed which is their statement of faith is the equivalent of converting.\n\nSpokespeople for the Charles County Public Schools have refused to comment other than to say they have not received any such lawsuit yet. However, the Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and Charles County Board of Education were all named in the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit says,\n\n\u201cDuring its brief instruction on Christianity, Defendants failed to cover any portion of the Bible or other non-Islamic religious texts, such as the Ten Commandments. Instead, the class included disparaging remarks about Christianity and the Pope. Such discriminatory treatment of Christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another. United States Supreme Court precedent does not create a double standard that allows for the promotion of Islam in our public schools while disallowing and silencing teachings of Christianity and Judaism.\u201d\n\nClassroom assignment copies indicate the teachers were instructing students that most Muslim people\u2019s faith are stronger than that of the average Christian. As well, the copies show they taught students that Islam is a peaceful religion that treated their conquered nations with kindness and respect too.\n\nPart of the handout reads,\n\n\u201cNowhere in the Koran does it say you will go to paradise if you martyr yourself with a suicide bomb. Important: The majority of Muslims do not live this way.\u201d\n\nIt referenced the jihad as,\n\n\u201ca holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.\u201d\n\nThis reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year.

Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.\n\nThe story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren\u2019t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.\n\nThank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a \u2018disobedient\u2019 woman.

        "text": "Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.\n\nFirst proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.\n\nIn other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.\n\nAs Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won\u2019t know the law, and they\u2019ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,\u201d Gitlin said. \u201cThat can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.\u201d\n\nAs we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to watch Pennsylvania,\u201d Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. \u201cGo down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don\u2019t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we\u2019re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion \u2013 I really mean this, Pennsylvania \u2013 is if cheating goes on.\u201d\n\nTrump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to \u201cStop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!\u201d\n\nIn response to Trump\u2019s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.\n\nWith the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump\u2019s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.\n\nFeatured Image: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",

They can\u2019t even play the race card on this one, but they\u2019ll still wreck a town for no reason.\n\nIt makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?\n\nNothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.\n\nDing ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn\u2019t listen to police.\n\nThat must mean it\u2019s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don\u2019t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.\n\nMadworld News \u2013 Rioters swarmed this man\u2019s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It\u2019s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don\u2019t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn\u2019t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.\n\nIf I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I\u2019d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they\u2019d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.\n\nBlack Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They\u2019re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.\n\nBlack Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.\n\nThey\u2019re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they\u2019re white. They attack people just because they\u2019re white.\n\nThey call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can\u2019t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.\n\nI judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.\n\nBased off what I\u2019ve seen so far, I can proudly say F*ck Black Lives Matter and the hoopty they drove in on.",

Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President.

Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.\n\nObama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he\u2019s enjoying that Gilligan\u2019s Island by himself.\n\nHow ridiculous!

And what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards.\"\n\nClinton spoke out Tuesday against \"systematic racism\" following the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time.\n\nThe Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that \"approximately 12 officers\" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer.\n\nMook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities.\n\n\"The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,\" he said.\n\nClinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday's \"The Steve Harvey Morning Show\" that she plans to speak \"directly to white people\" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America.\n\n\"What she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,\" he said. \"If you are African-American or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. And that's a problem.\"\n\nClinton said Tuesday that while there are \"good, honorable, cool-headed police officers\" working across the country, \"we can do better.\"\n\n\"We have got to tackle systemic racism,\" Clinton said. \"This horrible shooting again. How many times do we have to see this in our country?\"\n\n\"This is just unbearable,\" Clinton said. \"And it needs to be intolerable.\"\n\nClinton later tweeted on the shooting, writing, \"Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident.

        "text": "United Nations (CNN) President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis \"of epic proportions,\" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence.\n\nThe President's interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world, and pushing back against the anti-refugee tenor, was underscored by his decision to convene a Leaders' Summit on Refugees at the United Nations Tuesday.\n\nAt the summit, he also rejected another aspect of the American political debate swirling around accepting foreigners -- GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's call to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.\n\n\"This crisis is a test of our common humanity. Whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls, or whether we see ourselves in another,\" Obama said, though he didn't mention Trump by name.\n\nObama singled out the situation in Syria, which has displaced 4.8 million people so far, as particularly \"unacceptable.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED President Obama at the UN: Then and now Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH President Obama at the UN: Then and now 01:45\n\n\"We are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop,\" he said, describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries' ability to take collective action.\n\n\"I called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time,\" he said. \"Just as failure to act in the past -- for example, by turning away Jews fleeing Nazi Germany -- is a stain on our collective conscience, I believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment.\"\n\nThe refugee issue is one that's captured the world's attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since World War II, seared into the public's consciousness by photos like that of a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean and the flood of migrants into Europe.\n\nA recent study by from the UN's refugee agency estimated 65.3 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, up by over five million from the prior year. Many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries, but about 21.3 million are classified as refugees.\n\nObama's summit follows a similar UN-led meeting on the issue Monday, which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments.\n\n\"Make no mistake,\" US Secretary of State John Kerry said at the UN meeting, \"additional efforts are urgently needed.\"\n\nLeaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows -- acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regions.\n\n\"You have to know that today the European Union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders,\" European Council President Donald Tusk said in his remarks, signaling a growing sense that patience in Europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin.\n\n\"There will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants,\" he added.\n\nThe Obama administration is hopeful the Leader's Summit on Tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action.\n\nNational Security Advisor Susan Rice in June announced that the gathering -- co-hosted along with the US by Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, Sweden and the UN Secretary General -- would seek an increase in funding of at least 30%, a doubling of permanent resettlement, and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees.\n\n\"Reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging, yet the level of need demands no less,\" Rice said in a statement.\n\nBut aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed.\n\n\"We have to be optimistic that we'll see some real concrete commitments,\" said Amnesty International's Interim Executive Director Margaret Huang. \"But the truth is, even if those numbers are hit, it's nowhere near what's actually needed.\"\n\nThe US is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees -- particularly Syria's neighbors -- and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to America from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 next year.\n\nThe President's chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action, it is limited in what it can do.\n\n\"The President's commitment to ensuring that the United States plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in Congress, including by a lot of people in the Republican majority in Congress,\" Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. \"And that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort.\"\n\nVetting efforts to screen refugees, he noted, \"are not cheap.\"\n\nDavid Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee and a former British Foreign Secretary, said he's hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action.\n\n\"The scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response,\" Miliband told CNN. \"Governments around the world haven't, in the main, been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now.\"\n\nBut the co-hosts of the Leaders' Summit said in a statement they were pleased with \"new and significant humanitarian contributions\" from world leaders.\n\n\"We sought a $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years,\" they said. \"Through our mutual efforts, over the course of 2016, the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 4.5 billion additional dollars to UN appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015.\"\n\nAs they await action from world leaders in New York, a group of volunteers in London laid out a \"life jacket graveyard\" Monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who've lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe conflict in Syria and resulting migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months, but refugees are a global problem.\n\nPerhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the so-called \"global south\" -- the developing countries of the southern hemisphere. Last week, South Sudan joined the ranks of Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia -- countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroad.\n\nAnd protracted conflict in places like Somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees -- men and women in their twenties who've never known life outside of a camp.\n\n\"These are not people who can envision what life would be like if they were returned to their home countries,\" Huang said.",

Islam isn\u2019t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they\u2019ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.\n\nThe insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.\n\nDemocrats think the world will agree with them, and they\u2019re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:\n\nA new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.\n\nSo Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says \u201cAmerica first\u201d it\u2019s suddenly racist.\n\nOk, yeah, that sounds logical.\n\nSixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. \u201cFloored\u201d by the results, the pollster laments that the \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d, who he previously thought were just a \u201cmarginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia\u201d, is too big to ignore. He writes: \u201cThis not a \u2018basket of deplorables\u2019 who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. \u201cYes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or \u2018other\u2019 but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.\u201d\n\nDo you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don\u2019t call them \u201cdeplorables,\u201d you recognize that half the country is against you.

No,\" Trump said. \"Are those words reserved only for hard-working Americans who truly love our country and they want to make a statement? One can be forgiven for getting the impression that these hardworking Americans are somehow a greater threat to our country than these Islamic extremists.\"\n\nRead More",

        "text": "Getty Images Fourth Estate In Defense of \u2018He Said/She Said\u2019 Journalism Why we must give the devil his due.\n\nThe \u201che said/she said\u201d method of reporting\u2014in which journalists observe the profession\u2019s convention and get at least two sides of every story\u2014has been taking it on the chin ever since New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen placed it in his gunsights in 2009 and started ack-acking it with regularity.\n\nBut the \"he said/she said\" debate didn\u2019t move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the New York Times abandoned mechanical balance and published a Page One, above-the-fold piece by Michael Barbaro, shredding Donald Trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest \u201cbirther\u201d declaration. The Times piece elated critics of the \"he said/she\" said construct. In an Atlantic piece titled \u201cThe Death of \u2018He Said, She Said\u2019 Journalism,\u201d Peter Beinart pronounced Barbaro\u2019s work a journalistic sea change. Trump had broken all the rules of political conduct, Beinart stated, and the Times had rightly ditched a few of its own. Abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette, which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what they\u2019re actually doing is lying, the Times piece dealt with Trump with \u201castonishing bluntness,\u201d Beinart wrote, repeatedly calling Trump\u2019s birther nonsense a \u201clie.\u201d Trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges, which sits just fine with the \"he said/she said\" critics.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile I consider Trump to be a first-rate liar and don\u2019t mind saying so, I\u2019m not convinced that jettisoning the \"he said/she said\" blueprint is such a good idea. Every politician lies. If we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way Barbaro did Trump, it would be entertaining. But political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances. Isn\u2019t that what the fact-checker columns are for?\n\nIn his widely applauded critiques of \"he said/she said\" journalism, Rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the \u201cother side\u201d of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth, the media creates a bogus symmetry between the \u201che said\u201d voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the \u201cshe said\u201d dissent. \u201cDo users really want to be left helpless in sorting out who\u2019s faking it more?\u201d Rosen asked, proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion. The \"he said/she said\" structure constitutes \u201cone of the lowest forms of journalism in existence,\u201d he would later remark.\n\nDonald Trump, the thinking goes, has gamed the \"he said/she said\" convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies, obfuscations and double-talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue, a clarification of something he\u2019s said, or a response to a point raised by his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This is true. In speeches and interviews, he\u2019s expressed a broadband stream of lies, such as denying that he\u2019s used terms like \u201cfat pig\u201d to describe women, insisting that he never called George W. Bush a liar, claiming that he opposed the Iraq War, making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy, asserting that the NFL had contacted him about the debate schedule, and more, much more. But they are lies, all lies. And every time the media quotes one of Trump\u2019s \u201cshe said\u201d lies without a correcting fact-check, it undermines the truth of the \u201che said\u201d side of the debate. At least, so the thinking goes.\n\nBut has journalists' practice of giving Trump the right of reply, allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster? One result of the straight, \"he said/she said\" coverage of the Trump style has been his record lows in the Washington Post/ABC News favorability poll. Thanks to this coverage, many voters are able to see through Trump\u2019s \u201cpost-truth\u201d style of politics and don\u2019t need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks. Among his supporters, many don\u2019t care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the trickster\u2019s campaign he\u2019s waging for the presidency: He\u2019s serving baloney and his supporters can\u2019t get enough of it.\n\nAs bracing and as full of truth-telling as the Barbaro piece was, I hope it doesn\u2019t embolden other news pages to abandon convention. The formula, when properly executed, forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles. The form is even more useful for skeptical \u201cshow me\u201d readers, who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue. This, I realize, can be especially challenging with Trump because the Mouth of Manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything. He is the hermaphrodite of opinion makers\u2014both \"he said and she said\"\u2014and, like any good circus freak, that makes him too exceptional to build rules from.\n\nOne reason I admire \"he said/she said\" journalism is that I often find myself sympathizing with the \"she-said\" side of the equation, and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry. Whenever the \"she-said\" component of a story goes missing, leaving only the dominant position expressed, I get the feeling I\u2019m being fed bunk. Even the Holy Bible gives Satan a forum for his dastardly views. So why not news stories?\n\nI don\u2019t believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides (or multiple sides) hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium. But intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any field\u2014ruling paradigms, if you don\u2019t mind the language\u2014have a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques. In order for thought to progress, the minority report\u2014however seemingly misguided\u2014must be heard.\n\nThe history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she-saiders. Early in the last century, for example, the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics, which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization, institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just. To oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus, to define yourself as a crackpot, to be reduced to a \"she-said\" if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story. Today, we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes.\n\nOr consider the story of Alfred Wegener. He 1912, he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift. Not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect, and his critics take his place as geology\u2019s crackpots. Or take the example of Australian doctor Barry Marshall, who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers, a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults. Even after Marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing Helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment. \u201cYou think, \u2018It\u2019s science; it\u2019s got to be accepted,\u2019\u201d Marshall told Discover magazine. \u201cBut it\u2019s not an absolute given.\u201d By the mid-1990s, the idea finally took root, undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery. In 2005, Marshall and a colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their Helicobacter pylori work. Science abounds with equally dramatic stories.\n\nObviously, the critiques of every she-saider don\u2019t automatically end in the triumphs Wegener and Marshall enjoyed. But when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years, the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going. Fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis. The \u201cone-size, fits all\u201d advice on mammograms has been abandoned. Our views on saturated fat, once almost holy writ, have been chucked. Until 1973, the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. (All is not progress: Some now argue that \u201chomophobia\u201d is an indicator of a disorder.) Marijuana makes you mad. (Today, the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you.) Coffee, once thought to be bad for you, turns out to be good for you, at least for now. Moving over to the policy realm, the once dominant \u201csuper-predator\u201d thesis was once supported across partisan lines. It is now discredited. Remember how Japan\u2019s economy was supposed to overtake the United States\u2019? Remember how Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economic system was stable? Experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing. Others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide. And so on.\n\nThe dissents of the she-saiders are generally beneficial. Whether right or wrong, the dissenters have a way of increasing everybody\u2019s knowledge. If they are wrong, as Michael Shermer has written, their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self-examine, and if warranted, use new evidence to improve its position. If the she-saiders are right, they advance human thought. That\u2019s how science works, and I believe journalism should work that way, too. Vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee-jerk paradigm-defenders with this progression. \u201cFirst,\u201d Salk writes, they say \u201cthat it can\u2019t be true.\u201d Second phase: \u201cWell, if it\u2019s true, it\u2019s not very important.\u201d Third phase: \u201cWell, we\u2019ve known it all along.\u201d\n\nBefore anybody puts words in my mouth, this is not my long-winded way of saying I don\u2019t subscribe to the global warming hypothesis. I do\u2014but at the same time, I keep my options open. The protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers. Even against crackpots.\n\nThe last and best reason for supporting \u201che said/she said\u201d journalism: So many readers and viewers have self-segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views. These days, many readers get only the \"he said\" side of the story or just the \"she said\" side, remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on. While I value partisan media, I also value nonpartisan news operations\u2014like POLITICO\u2014that make ideas duel in their news pages. NPR News Director Michael Oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars: \u201c[I]f you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing, you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts. That is why the tone of journalism matters so much. We need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly, and not to confirm our opinions.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re not getting a steady diet of \"she said\" quotations in your news consumption, you\u2019re at risk of starving to death. \"He said/she said\" keeps journalists honest, even if, on occasion, it looks like it\u2019s only accruing to the benefit of a beast like Donald Trump.\n\n******\n\nA sumptuous meal of news, news, news.

It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.\r\n\r\nLaw enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.\r\n(via Mad News World)\r\n\r\nPolice were unable to determine why the woman, described as an \u201cIslamic refugee,\u201d was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.\r\n\r\nThe plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico.

The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.\r\n\r\nJudicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.\r\n\r\nCongress should approve funding for President Trump\u2019s border wall at once.

Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.\r\n\r\nMany of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.\r\n\r\nIf a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.\r\n\r\nThe only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border.

Going into Monday\u2019s crucial first presidential debate, the Republican candidate understood that the most dangerous hurdle he had to get around was if the moderator called him on his lies. Trump, who has dismissed preparing for the debate out of hand, lies a lot. That\u2019s his strength. He needs it to win.\n\nPolitico recently analyzed Trump\u2019s last five days on the campaign trail and found that Donald Trump lies at a rate of once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds.\n\nTrump\u2019s misrepresentations range from false pronouncements (he again wrongly said he opposed the war in Iraq before it began) to the petty (he insisted Clinton had copied him by holding rallies with her plane in the background and insinuated she was \u201csleeping\u201d when she held no public events). He contradicted his own policy on providing health care to the poor, overstated the ad-spending discrepancy between his campaign and Clinton\u2019s and exaggerated the size of his primary victories and polling leads.\n\n(For what it\u2019s worth, they also fact-checked Clinton and found that while she, like any politician, does fudge the truth occasionally, Trump\u2019s lying \u201cso greatly exceed[s] Clinton\u2019s as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.\u201d Ouch.)\n\nAnd while Debate Commissioner Brown used an intentionally vague example (\u201cunemployment rate\u201d), there is no indication that Trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced. One example that might come up: Donald Trump continues to insist that the crime rate in America is going through the roof. This is a blatant lie that is exposed by just quick glance at the FBI\u2019s crime statistics. The debate moderator doesn\u2019t need to serve as the \u201cEncyclopedia Britannica,\u201d he or she just needs to know the basic facts. Big and small. And not let Trump get away with misleading the American people who are tuning in.\n\nJournalists, whose job it is to deal in facts, are furious with this caving to Trump.\n\nIf reporters aren't supposed to factcheck at debates, why exactly are reporters moderators to begin with?

No such thing.\n\nGood men\u2019s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.\n\nEspecially now in Obama\u2019s America.

Don\u2019t talk about God, it hurts people\u2019s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it\u2019s heroes.\n\nWith this kind of garbage happening\u2026the truth becomes that much more obvious.\n\nWords like \u2018tolerance\u2019 are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.\n\nAsk yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?\n\nThere is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.\n\n\u2026and Obama\u2019s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",

I am not sure I would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue and it\u2019s a presidential virtue,\u201d Conway told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe Tuesday. \u201cTo tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton \u2018I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.\u2019 That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWith just minutes left in Monday night\u2019s debate, Clinton managed to work in a line of attack against Trump that she has also used most-recently in a new campaign ad, hitting the Manhattan billionaire as \u201ca man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs.\u201d After the debate, Trump told CNN that \u201c\u201cI was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,\u201d indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with Clinton\u2019s husband and daughter in the audience.\n\nTuesday morning, Conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly Trump\u2019s attack might have been.\n\n\u201cI think he could have said what was on millions of Americans\u2019 minds, no doubt, that are we going to relitigate who\u2019s been good to women and who hasn't?\u201d Conway said. \u201cThey\u2019re taking a couple comments he made over any number of years as a private citizen, versus where he could have gone, and I think we all can finish the sentence. People did last night, they finished the sentence, they said, you know, maybe he was going to talk about Bill Clinton's record with women, but he decided not to.\u201d\n\nOverall, Conway said Clinton failed to deliver a \u201cknockout punch\u201d that would have forced Trump into a major error. Instead, Trump\u2019s campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation, regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator Lester Holt.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked, and I thought Hillary Clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered, she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Conway said.\n\n\u201cI don't think Hillary Clinton did a thing last night. If somebody can correct me, what was the big takeaway moment where she offers this huge vision for economic growth and an end to wage stagnation,\u201d she added. \u201cSo I didn't hear any big moment for her where she convinced the 70 percent of Americans who want change, who want a different direction, that she's their gal.\u201d\n\nAuthors:",

        "text": "\n\nPlastic glasses, knives, forks and food boxes are being been banned in France. (Bertrand Combaldieu/Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 France has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. Exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials.\n\nThe new law is a part of the country\u2019s Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in July. Although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries \u2014 including in some U.S. states \u2014 no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as France\u2019s will be.\n\nThe general idea behind the law \u2014 following the landmark conference held in Paris last fall on curbing global warming \u2014 is to promote a \u201ccircular economy\u201d of waste disposal, \u201cfrom product design to recycling,\u201d French lawmakers say.\n\n[A Maryland county\u2019s nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned]\n\nObjections to plastic as a material are well known. For one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. Aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change.\n\nIn the words of French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended \u201cto make France \u2026 an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources\u201d -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines.\n\nNot all share the enthusiasm of France\u2019s Socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. In Brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing European Union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers.\n\nEamonn Bates, the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, a Brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the Associated Press that his organization will challenge France\u2019s ban.\n\n\u201cWe are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, we will.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. But S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, the French environment minister, had initially considered it an \u201canti-social\u201d provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates.\n\nThe ban was then postponed until 2020.",

But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump\u2019s tax returns as well as other things.\n\nLook at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.\n\nDonald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.\n\n521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton\u2019s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.\n\nRegardless of these apparent \u201cwinning\u201d results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.\n\nWith the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let\u2019s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. We all must wait and see.",

It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. \u2014 BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let\u2019s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot,\u201d Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.\n\n\u201cThe protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,\u201d Meyer told me almost breathlessly, \u201cI\u2019ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant \u2018hands up, don\u2019t shoot\u2019 and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter leaving \u2018The Epicenter,\u2019 police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful \u2013 and that\u2019s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.\u201d\n\nMeyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass.

At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn\u2019t already left, exited.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.\n\nIt took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was \u2018entirely too loud for a gunshot too.

He\u2019s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he\u2019s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.\n\nThroughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. \u201cFor the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia\u201d he tweeted in July. Now \u2013 brace yourself, this might come as a shock \u2013 it appears he\u2019s been lying to us the whole time.\n\nAn ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has \u201cnumerous ties\u201d to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. \u201cThe level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate\u2014[and] be associated with Donald Trump\u201d says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.\n\nTrump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to \u201clarge numbers\u201d of Russian buyers \u2013 so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as \u201cLittle Moscow.\u201d\n\nThe oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.\n\nThe oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense \u2013 they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.\n\n\u201cI think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing.

Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it\u2019s that Trump cares about nothing but himself.

He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.\n\nBut lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now.\n\nTrump is saying \u201cyes\u201d to Fox News almost every day but saying \u201cno\u201d to most other major networks and news organizations \u2014 a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Monday morning, he is booked on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate\u2019s exposure to hard-hitting questions \u2014 while fueling frustration among journalists.\n\nAt Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts won\u2019t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isn\u2019t challenged \u2013 and that\u2019s the way he wants it.\n\nThe problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isn\u2019t reaching out.\n\nIt is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in \u201cswing\u201d districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted.\n\nOn election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney \u201clandslide\u201d the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.\n\nFeatured image via Flickr",

Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:\n\nThe decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.\n\nChris Christie is also Republican Presidential\u2019s nominee Donald Trump\u2019s transition team chairperson.\n\nJust four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world\u2019s busiest bridges.\n\nGovernor Christie was Trump\u2019s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major \u201cconservative\u201d Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump\u2019s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.\n\nFamously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It\u2019s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor\u2019s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.\n\nLast week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.\n\nThe Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration\u2019s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year\u2019s Republican Presidential campaign.\n\nWatch his shame:\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump\u2019s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn\u2019t want to admit he lost.\n\nAssume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush\u2019s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies\u2014he had played the \u201ccash for outcomes\u201d political game for years\u2014he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush\u2019s opposition\u2014if Trump had wanted it.\n\nThe transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would\u2019ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump\u2019s na\u00efve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald\u2019s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:\n\nNow consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn\u2019t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple\u2014Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.\n\nWhy is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater \u201cscandal\u201d for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.\n\nRepublicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump\u2019s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party\u2019s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it\u2019s head.\n\nTrump\u2019s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it\u2019s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.\n\nSee for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there\u2019s no third option here:\n\nBush: \u201cThe one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something\u2014that was generous and gave me money\u2014was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.\u201d Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn\u2019t\u2014 Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn\u2019t get it, because I was opposed to\u2014 Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before\u2014 Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I\u2019m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.\n\nTranscript of 2007 Trial Deposition:\n\nA lawyer asked Trump, \u201cDid you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?\u201d Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush\u2026and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn\u2019t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn\u2019t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.\r\n\r\nLast year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, \"especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year.\" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015\r\n\r\nThe story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.\r\n\r\nAccording to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's \"rigorous fact-checking\" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the \"birther moment\" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.\r\n\r\nSo, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.\r\n\r\nSo, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",

The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company\u2019s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.\n\nSources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment\u2019s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump\u2019s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. \u201cThe likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nIronically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee\u2019s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel\u2019s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he\u2019s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.\n\nThiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan\u2019s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire\u2019s then-secret sexual orientation.\n\nBut now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP\u2019s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, \u201cEvery American has a unique identity. I\u2019m proud to be gay, I\u2019m proud to be a Republican,\u201d after a lengthy rant against \u201cgovernment incompetence.\u201d He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.\n\nUnfortunately, his own party didn\u2019t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.\n\n\u201cFederal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,\u201d said the Department of Labor\u2019s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. \u201cOur nation\u2019s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.\u201d Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself \u201cvigorously\u201d and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.\n\nNow, the executive who accused his employer \u2013 the federal government \u2013 of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company\u2019s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

For these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem,\" he said.\n\n\"It may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with Trump.

No other candidates qualified.\n\nWho will moderate the debate?\n\nLester Holt, who anchors \"NBC Nightly News,\" will be the moderator. It\u2019s his second time serving in that role in the 2016 presidential cycle. Holt was also a moderator for the Democratic primary debate on January 17. On February 15, 2015 Holt became the substitute anchor of NBC Nightly News after Brian Williams was suspended. Four months later he became the permanent anchor.\n\nWhat is the format of the debate?\n\nThe debate will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. Each segment will start with a question from Holt, after which each candidates will have two minutes for an initial response and then will be allowed to respond to each other. On Monday, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the tentative topics for the debate: \u201cAmerica's direction,\u201d \u201cachieving prosperity,\u201d and \u201csecuring America.\u201d The topics are subject to change based on news developments, according to the commission.\n\nWhy aren't Jill Stein or Gary Johnson participating in the debate?\n\nLibertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein were not invited by the presidential debate commission. The commission said it would only invite candidates that averaged 15 percent in five national polls it selected. Neither Johnson nor Stein made that threshold.\n\nWhat's at stake for Hillary Clinton?\n\nThe debate is Clinton\u2019s chance to turn the page on a few weeks during which Trump has eaten much of the polling lead she built following her convention. Clinton\u2019s camp has also been counting on her policy knowledge and debate experience to help her expose Trump\u2019s weaknesses, but the Democratic candidate also comes in facing higher expectations than Trump.\n\nWhat's at stake for Donald Trump?\n\nTrump has been accused lacking policy gravitas and self-restraint, and both of those perceived weaknesses could be exposed in a debate, where candidates will be grilled on their familiarity with issues foreign and domestic and be expected to keep composed under rhetorical assault from their opponents. Trump has the advantage, however, of low expectations: At several turns in the presidential campaign, even modest pivots away from his bombastic primary style were hailed as pivots to professionalism, and a similar self-restraint \u2014 provided he still hits the high notes his supporters are expected \u2014 could help him clear the low bar again.\n\nWhat is the most watched debate in presidential history?\n\nIn 1980 the debate between President Jimmy Carter and Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan garnered a viewership of 80.6 million people, the largest television audience for a debate since Nielsen Ratings began collecting viewership data in 1976. In 2012, the first general election presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney attracted about 70 million viewers.\n\nWhat's the most-watched television moment of all time?\n\nSuper Bowl XLIX in 2015 on NBC is currently the most watched television program in U.S. history, attracting 114 million viewers, according to NBC News. The New England Patriots played against the Seattle Seahawks, winning the game 28-24.\n\nStill, that pales in comparison to the estimated 600 million people worldwide who watched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make the first moon landing on July 20, 1969, or the estimated 750 million people worldwide that watched Prince Charles of Wales marry Lady Diana Spencer on July 29, 1981.\n\nAuthors:",

        "text": "Newark (CNN) Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge \"as bad as possible,\" according to testimony heard in federal court Monday.\n\nDavid Wildstein, former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects, testified that in June 2013, Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey, Mark Sokolich, for Christie's reelection campaign.\n\nWildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option, according to his testimony.\n\nWildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. Sokolich testified last week that being a \"Democrat in a Democratic town\" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a Christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to \"alienate anyone.\"\n\nOn August 13, 2013, and as CNN has previously reported, Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying: \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\"\n\n\"Got it,\" Wildstein responded.\n\nA phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony Monday.\n\n\"I did not question senior officials in the office of the governor,\" Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision.\n\nWildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his then-boss, former Port Authority deputy executive director, Bill Baroni, according to his testimony.\n\nWildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public. They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baroni's office and Baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed.\n\nThis \"radio silence\" policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni, Wildstein said.\n\nWildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to \"maximize the impact on Fort Lee.\" Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and Kelly.\n\nBaroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was, and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9, Baroni smiled and said, \"Fantastic,\" according to Wildstein's testimony. Kelly agreed on the September 9 date.\n\nWildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause \"sideswipe crashes,\" Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanes.\n\nOn Friday, September 6, 2013, Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday, September 9.\n\nBob Durando, Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern, telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a \"mess.\"\n\nWildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly.\n\n\"I told him not to say anything to anybody,\" Wildstein testified. Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baroni's office.\n\nWildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer, Peter Zipf, of the closures, and asked Zipf to organize a way to get \"some numbers\" on the traffic patterns.\n\nWildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton, Port Authority director of Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals. Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director, Patrick Foye, was aware. Wildstein testified that he told Fulton \"yes,\" but that this was a lie.\n\nAll of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study.\n\nOn the day the closures began, Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington Bridge.\n\n\"I knew the plan that I had set into motion was working,\" Wildstein testified.\n\nA Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the ground.\n\nWildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and \"she was pleased.\"\n\nSeveral calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials, including the mayor, Sokolich, but their plan of \"radio silence\" was put into effect and no messages were returned.\n\nLast week, Wildstein testified that Baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of Christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent Christie's office's interests.\n\nWildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used, \"the one constituent rule.\" This referred to the fact that Governor Christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs. Wildstein and Baroni used the \"one constituent rule\" as a barometer by which decisions would be made.\n\nKelly and Baroni face conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with Bridgegate. Their attorneys have previously said they will both testify in their own defenses.",

For real.\n\nThis is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from \u201cintentionally or knowingly touching\u201d the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don\u2019t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.\n\nThe AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that \u201cprosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.\u201d They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?\n\nIn others words, just trust the prosecutors, y\u2019all. There\u2019s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.\n\nWow.\n\nThere are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here\u2019s an especially interesting tidbit:\n\nAs Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority\u2019s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court\u2019s help, Arizona\u2019s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver\u2014out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state\u2019s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona\u2019s parents and caregivers.\n\nYikes.\n\nBut I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll all just work itself out.

Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think it\u2019s perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow.\n\nBiden said:\n\n\u201cThis is a guy who said \u2014 and wants to be president \u2014 that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?\u201d\n\nAdding:\n\n\u201cEvery president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we\u2019re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.\u201d\n\nThen really getting to the core of it, he said:\n\n\u201cHe does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don\u2019t take pleasure from \u2018You\u2019re fired.\u2019 They don\u2019t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.\u201d\n\nBiden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and don\u2019t have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage.\n\n\u201cHe acknowledged that he didn\u2019t pay taxes because, he said, he\u2019s smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here who\u2019s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.\u201d\n\nBiden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates:\n\n\u201cIf this choice isn\u2019t clear, I don\u2019t know \u2013- my lord\u2026 What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s true, the choice is abundantly clear \u2014 Hillary Rodham Clinton should and will be our next president.\n\nWatch Biden lay into Trump here:\n\nWATCH: VP Biden goes off on Trump over Trump\u2019s comments about not paying taxes: \u201cIt angers me! \u2026 What in the hell is he talking about!?\u201d pic.twitter.com/Qg5L5HcnvL \u2014 NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) September 27, 2016\n\nFeatured image via video screen capture",

        "text": "There\u2019s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable \u2013 except by Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:\n\nWhile on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics \u2026. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.\n\nAfter Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:\n\nFor the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator \u2026 to call out those lies and to do that in real time.\n\nUnfortunately, with Trump\u2019s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it\u2019s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to \u201cshine\u201d at the debate if she hopes to \u201cwin.\u201d This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.\n\nHopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.\n\nIf there is one thing this election has shown us, it\u2019s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.\n\nFeatured image via Sara D.

        "text": "The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general said that 858 people who were ordered to be deported or removed instead eventually received citizenship. | AP Photo U.S. mistakenly granted citizenship to hundreds of immigrants\n\nAt least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S. were instead granted citizenship, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general announced Monday.\n\nThe mistaken citizenships were granted, the Department of Homeland Security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the FBI\u2019s fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe discovery was made by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s office of inspector general, which released a report Monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. The FBI\u2019s records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau.\n\nThe inspector general's report specified that those granted citizenship were only \"potentially\" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship.\n\n\"It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. Preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted,\" department spokesman Neema Hakim said in the statement. \"Other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed.\"\n\nIn at least three cases, the inspector general\u2019s office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for \u201csecurity-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels.\u201d The release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked.\n\n\u201cThis situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,\u201d Inspector General John Roth said. \u201cTo prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] needs access to these fingerprint records.\u201d\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the U.S. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the GOP primary that America temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. He has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from \u201cany nation that has been compromised by terrorism.\u201d\n\nAuthors:",

        "text": "The pressure is on Hillary Clinton.\n\nInsiders in both parties agree: Clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than Donald Trump when the two square off for the first debate on Long Island.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat\u2019s according to The POLITICO Caucus \u2014 a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues.\n\n\u201cShe shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review,\u201d said a Nevada Democrat \u2014 who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. \u201cHillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump,\u201d a New Hampshire Democrat added. \u201cPresidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.\u201d\n\nOne Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,\u201d said the Ohio Democrat. \u201cShe will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.\u201d\n\nRepublicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states.\n\n\u201cSomehow she needs to reverse the trend,\u201d said an Ohio Republican. \u201cNever seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance \u2014 and maybe her last chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has to stop [Trump\u2019s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,\u201d added a Virginia Republican. \u201cAll [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.\u201d\n\nAmong those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure \u2014 31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans \u2014 most pointed to the GOP nominee\u2019s volatile personality.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk,\u201d said a Michigan Republican. \u201cThe pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious?\u201d added a Michigan Democrat. \u201cCan he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?\u201d\n\nTwo other takeaways from the pre-debate survey:\n\nMost insiders expect Clinton to \u201cwin\u201d the debate.\n\nMajorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans.\n\n\u201cMedia look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary,\u201d said an Iowa Republican.\n\n\u201c[Clinton\u2019s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,\u201d added a New Hampshire Democrat.\n\nBut not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton \u2014 or the media through which voters will interpret the debate.\n\n\u201cThe press wants Trump to win,\u201d said a Florida Democrat. \u201cTheir disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans also claimed media bias \u2014 in the other direction.\n\n\u201cThe media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won,\u201d a Virginia Republican said. \u201cBut then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.\u201d\n\nInsiders think the debate will matter.\n\nAsked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates.\n\nAmong Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percent don\u2019t expect the debate to move the needle.\n\n\u201cTrump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),\u201d a Michigan Democrat predicted. \u201cThe moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.\u201d\n\nThe numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said it wouldn\u2019t have a significant impact.\n\n\u201cTrump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,\u201d said a New Hampshire Republican. \u201cHe does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.\u201d\n\nBut some Republicans said Clinton could stunt Trump\u2019s momentum with a strong performance Monday night.\n\n\u201cIf she pins his ears back, [it helps her],\u201d said an Iowa Republican. \u201cIf it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.\u201d\n\nOther insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race.\n\n\u201cWe're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments,\u201d an Iowa Republican said. \u201cSwing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.\u201d\n\nAdded a Florida Democrat: \u201cDoes a damn thing matter this year? I think not.\u201d\n\nThese are the members of The POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this special survey:\n\nColorado: Ryan Call, Laura Carno, Matt Chandler, Will Coyne, Adam Eichberg, Mark Ferrandino, Cole Finegan, Michael Fortney, Andrew Freedman, Ted Harvey, Craig Hughes, Owen Loftus, Pete Maysmith, Frank McNulty, Karen Middleton, Christopher Murray, BJ Nikkel, Josh Penry, Rick Ridder, Alan Salazar, Janice Sinden, Pat Steadman, Pat Waak, Steve Welchert, Taylor West, Roxane White, Rob Witwer\n\nFlorida: Fernand Amandi, Scott Arceneaux, JP Austin, Tim Baker, Dennis K.

        "text": "\n\nPosted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016\n\nDonald Trump Jr. Is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. In the very least, it\u2019s a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown.\n\nTogether, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybe we\u2019ll keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then.\n\nToday\u2019s silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom.\n\nFor the left, it\u2019s a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but let\u2019s not forget that it\u2019s people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason.\n\nFor years, we\u2019ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to Mini Douche\u2019s Twitter account this morning, I couldn\u2019t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:\n\nClearly when you\u2019re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When \u201cliberals\u201d \u2014 otherwise known as \u201csane people\u201d \u2014 try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, we\u2019re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. It\u2019s not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you.\n\nThe Supreme Court has sided with those \u201cliberals\u201d every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. I\u2019ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and I\u2019ll say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute. All others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like Donald Trump Jr.\n\nFeatured image by Gage Skidmore",

The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.\n\nThat seems very bizarre considering that we\u2019ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?\n\nWell, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.\n\nWhile being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.\n\nThe group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.\n\nThis is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations.

        "text": "Donald Trump's reputation for being always available to reporters is way out of date.\n\nTrump is saying \"yes\" to Fox News almost every day but saying \"no\" to most other major networks and news organizations -- a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee.\n\nHe called into \"Fox & Friends\" on Monday morning, he is booked on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday.\n\nRousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate's exposure to hard-hitting questions -- while fueling frustration among journalists.\n\nTrump's surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than Hillary Clinton, but that is no longer true.\n\nNewt Gingrich knocked Clinton at a Trump rally on Monday afternoon by saying \"she doesn't do press conferences.\" But Clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks, including as recently as Monday morning.\n\nThese sessions, while relatively short, have been plentiful, while Trump has not held a press conference since July.\n\nTrump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought \u2014 especially since Trump made Clinton's eight-month period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point.\n\n\"It's been more than 50 days since Donald Trump held a press conference,\" David Martosko of The Daily Mail tweeted Monday.\n\nTrump's recent TV appearances, on \"The Dr. Oz Show\" and \"The Tonight Show,\" made news, but not in journalistic settings.\n\nThe Washington Post's Robert Costa had a newsmaking interview with Trump last week. But that's the exception to the rule. The New York Times last had an interview with Trump about a month ago.\n\nTrump last appeared on CNN in late August. Because Anderson Cooper challenged Trump about the candidate's muddled stance on immigration, The Post's Callum Borchers concluded that \"it didn't go very well\" for Trump.\n\n\"It went so not well, in fact, that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide it's best to dodge the likes of Anderson Cooper and Chuck Todd \u2014 or, for that matter, Chris Wallace and Bret Baier \u2014 and stick to softball sessions with Sean Hannity and the 'Fox & Friends' crew,\" Borchers wrote afterwards.\n\nTrump's last time on NBC was the \"Commander in Chief Forum\" on September 7. Moderator Matt Lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with Trump.\n\nRelated: Behind the scenes, NBC execs concede Matt Lauer forum performance was \"disaster\"\n\nThe candidate's last time on ABC was a short interview with David Muir on September 6. His last time on CBS was a \"60 Minutes\" sit-down with Lesley Stahl on July 17.\n\nTrump does have another CBS interview in the works, a campaign spokeswoman said.\n\nTV networks are agitating for more interviews with both Trump and Clinton. The difference between the two is that Trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time.\n\nThis accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps.\n\n\"Trump used to be very, very accessible to the press. At the beginning of his campaign, he was extremely accessible,\" CNN politics reporter Jeremy Diamond said on Sunday's \"Reliable Sources.\" \"You could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies. And that has really changed.\"\n\nDiamond said \"he is less accessible I think, in many regards, than Hillary Clinton at this point.\"\n\nTrump's campaign declined to comment Monday on its media strategy. Republican communications strategist Ron Bonjean said most candidates in Trump's position would be \"trying to reach a a broader general election audience.\"\n\n\"However, most Americans already know Trump as a household name and he doesn't need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure,\" Bonjean said. \"Trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience.\"\n\nThis conservative-focused media strategy is also gaining attention among Trump's critics. \"He pretty much exclusively appears on Fox News now,\" Judd Legum, editor of the liberal news site ThinkProgress, tweeted on Monday.\n\nTrump's relationship with Hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms. Trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator.\n\nAccording to TVNewser, Wednesday's town hall will focus on \"issues and concerns surrounding African-Americans this election cycle.\"\n\nAccording to Nielsen data, only 1.5% of Hannity's 2 million nightly viewers are African American. Overall, at any given time of day, about 2% of Fox News viewers are African American.",

Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot.

He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.\n\nNew Jersey State Police\n\nA U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings.\n\nFormer classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey.\n\nOne of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a \"pretty normal guy.\" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend.\n\nRahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.\n\nNew Jersey State Police\n\nThe Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there.\n\n\"I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,\" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. \"He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary.

He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks.\n\nLate Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million.

        "text": "CLEVELAND \u2014 Donald Trump campaigned Wednesday morning in a church in a historically African-American community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban America. Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling.\n\nIt was just another day in Trump\u2019s up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe effort has taken Trump from a black church in inner-city Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where, on Tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities \"are absolutely in the worst shape that they\u2019ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King \u2014 who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a \u201cgladiator.\u201d King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered.\n\n\u201cThe system is the problem, and he\u2019s the only gladiator that will take on the system,\u201d King said.\n\nAfter the church event, Trump sat for a \u201ctown hall\u201d with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address \u201cviolence in the black community,\u201d Trump embraced stop-and-frisk.\n\n\u201cWe did it in New York, it worked incredibly well,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nBut even before Trump\u2019s stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his \u201cever, ever, ever\u201d remark Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI don't know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it's ever been,\u201d Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. \u201cIs he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination \u2014 when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal \u2014 in the low single digits \u2014 and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks \u2014 \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d he says \u2014 to largely white audiences.\n\nAt the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd.\n\nSeated to Trump\u2019s right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (\u201cthere\u2019s only one,\u201d Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (\u201ctough\u201d), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (\u201ca tough general\u201d) and former \"Apprentice\" star Omarosa Manigault (\u201ca wonderful woman\u201d), who has helped with Trump\u2019s black outreach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m different from a lot of Republicans, frankly,\u201d Trump said from the pulpit.\n\nTrump, who has called himself the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been \u201cchoking\u201d in the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents.\n\n\"Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, OK?\u201d\n\nKing, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference.\n\nKing, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that \u201cthe system\u201d had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely.\n\n\u201cEvery white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump,\u201d said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans.\n\n\u201cI told Michael Jackson, I said if you're poor, you're a poor Negro \u2014 I would use the N-word \u2014 but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual Negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro,\u201d King said.\n\nWhen Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, \u201cAh, there\u2019s only one Don King.\u201d\n\nBefore King, Cohen, Trump\u2019s attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the \u201cdisgusting, liberal, mainstream media\u201d and its casting of Trump as a \u201cracist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe word of the 2016 election has somehow become \u2018racist,\u2019\u201d Cohen complained. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. And let\u2019s not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others. It\u2019s disgraceful.\u201d\n\nCohen said, \u201cNot only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.\u201d\n\nTrump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThey come and they take your vote,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand they say they\u2019ll see you in four years.\u201d\n\n\n\nAuthors:",

Trump also attempted to blame his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked.\n\nBut while Trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, Arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim that Obama\u2019s birth certificate was forged. On Tuesday in Phoenix, Arpaio addressed the conservative group that requested he investigate the document, saying that \u201cwe are looking at a forged document. Period.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Arpaio told POLITICO the investigation into the document is ongoing. He declined to detail what evidence that effort has turned up, but he claimed that his office has found nothing \u201cto say it\u2019s a legitimate document.\u201d\n\nArpaio also tried to separate himself from the birther movement, arguing that his investigation is focused on the document itself, rather than the president\u2019s birthplace, and denied that his skepticism is motivated by racism.\n\nStill, he would not say that he believes Obama was born in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI have no idea now where he was born,\u201d Arpaio said. \u201cYou hear a lot of stories.\u201d\n\nHe and Trump did not discuss the birth certificate issue before the nominee held the press conference last week, Arpaio said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was going to say it,\u201d he said.\n\nAuthors:",

        "text": "In March, in a bold \u201cOh yeah?\u201d moment during an interview with the Washington Post\u2019s editorial board, Donald Trump took the paper\u2019s dare and revealed, then and there, his very short list of foreign policy advisers. There were just five, though he said, \u201cI have quite a few more.\u201d The list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. One of the names, offered without elaboration, was, \u201cCarter Page, PhD.\u201d\n\nWho?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nReporters quickly Googling found that Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called Global Energy Capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector. As for his connection to Trump, when Page was reached for comment by the New York Times the day after Trump\u2019s big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he \u201cwill be advising Mr. Trump on energy policy and Russia.\u201d\n\nThis piqued my interest: I have been a Russia wonk for most of my adult life, I spent years living and reporting from Moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. And yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in Russia, no one I spoke to had ever heard of Carter Page.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this guy\u2019s name?\u201d says one former Western energy CEO who spent years in Russia, and would have overlapped there with Page.\n\n\u201cI had not heard of Carter Page before it came out in the media,\u201d says another prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades. \u201cBut I am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, \u2018Have you heard of this guy?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cStrangely, I've never heard of Carter Page until this Trump connection,\u201d Bill Browder responded to me in an email. He was one of the biggest Western players in the Russian market until President Vladimir Putin turned on him and Browder became his fierce critic. \u201cIt's odd, because I've heard of every other financier who was a player on Moscow at the time.\u201d\n\nSomeone, apparently, has heard of him: On Friday, Yahoo News reported that Page was being probed by U.S. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to Russian leaders. The story resurfaced the name of a character who\u2019d all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, Trump was surrounding himself with.\n\nThis has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious Washington connections to tap for advice. \u201cI\u2019m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,\" Trump famously told a Post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. \"We want top-of-the-line professionals.\u201d As the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that Trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump confused the Kurds with the Iranian Al-Quds Force, couldn\u2019t tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas, and couldn\u2019t recognize the name of the leader of ISIS. (In his defense, Trump said that \u201cHugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.\u201d) The Republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-Trump manifestos. And since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? What would they be like?\n\nEnter Carter Page, a 44-year-old Ph.D., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in Russia and energy, yet who, I quickly discovered, was known by neither Russia experts nor energy experts nor Russian energy experts. (\u201cI can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Carter who? You mean Jimmy Carter?\u2019\u201d says one veteran Western investor in Russian energy.) Page also, as I would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to Trump\u2019s own campaign.\n\nWhat I did find, however, is that while Page might not be helping Trump, Trump has been a significant help to Page. Since being named by Trump as an adviser, Page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in Russia and the former Soviet Union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. He is being treated in Russia as a person with potentially important ties in America. \u201cHe\u2019s an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on Russia,\u201d says Mikhail Leontiev, a pro-Kremlin talking head and spokesman for Rosneft, Russia\u2019s state oil giant. \u201cPeople really respect him in this industry. He\u2019s a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation.\u201d According to the Yahoo report, U.S. intelligence believes Page had an audience with top Russian officials\u2014including Rosneft head Igor Sechin\u2014during a summer trip to Moscow. From what I could find about him, it\u2019s hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by Trump.\n\nPage has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the American press. A March Bloomberg profile touted his \u201cdeep ties\u201d with \u201cexecutives at Gazprom,\u201d the state-owned Russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. Last month, the Post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in Russia, some of them unsavory. The Yahoo story also portrays Page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with \u201cextensive business interests in Russia\u201d and an office \u201caround the corner from Trump Tower.\u201d\n\nPage has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama to a June closed-door meeting of foreign policy Brahmins in Washington. In July, in Moscow, he spoke at the New Economic School\u2019s commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted Obama just seven years ago. Page used the speech to slam the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of American foreign policy in front of a Russian audience, saying, \u201cWashington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.\u201d He is now frequently quoted on Russian television, which hails him as a \u201cfamous American economist\u201d and \u201cadviser to Donald Trump on questions of foreign policy.\u201d\n\nAll of which reveals something deeply strange about Trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up Twitter controversies. They also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of \u201cinsiders,\u201d people who seem to be in Trump\u2019s orbit but who may not have\u2014and may never have had\u2014any access to the gilded inner sanctum at all.\n\nBut someone is paying attention. As I started looking into Page, I began getting calls from two separate \u201ccorporate investigators\u201d digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians. One is working on behalf of various unnamed Democratic donors; the other won\u2019t say who turned him on to Page\u2019s scent. Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin and Sergei Ivanov, who was until recently Putin\u2019s chief of staff\u2014both of whom are on the sanctions list\u2014when Page was in Moscow in July for that speech.\n\nSo the question continued to linger: Who is Carter Page?\n\n***\n\nI should tell you before we get any further that Page wouldn\u2019t talk to me for this story. I called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. I emailed him repeatedly. I asked the Trump campaign to put me in touch. I emailed the Bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. I even called Carter Page\u2019s father in Poughkeepsie, New York, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. But alas, no dice.\n\nThis was disappointing: No one who worked in Moscow when Page was there seemed to know who he was, and I just wanted to talk to someone who did. At a certain point, I just needed confirmation that he even existed.\n\nOK, I thought. Try a different route. Maybe all these prominent Western businessmen who worked in Russia for decades didn\u2019t know Page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the Russian economy. He did, after all, have such an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nPage\u2019s biography on the website of his energy fund, Global Energy Capital, hits all the right notes. It was, at first glance, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative Russian energy market. \u201cHe spent 7 years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch in London, Moscow and New York where he most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Power Group,\u201d his bio reads. \u201cHe was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. He spent 3 years in Moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the Merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for Gazprom, RAO UES and others.\u201d\n\nThose were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and Page\u2019s tenure in Merrill Lynch\u2019s Moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. He says he was part of the carving up of RAO UES, a massive Russian electric power holding company. He told Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom when it bought a stake in the Sakhalin II oil and gas project. Those were huge, huge things. If he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. And surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals.\n\nSo I called Ian Craig, the CEO of Sakhalin Energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with Gazprom and stayed on as CEO after the deal went through. (It wasn\u2019t really a deal, to be clear: Sakhalin II was a large project in the Far East, and Gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) But Craig said he didn\u2019t know anyone named Carter Page. He was also surprised to hear about Merrill Lynch\u2019s purported involvement in the deal. \u201cI don\u2019t think Merrill Lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political,\u201d says Craig . \u201cIt closed at CEO level, and eventually Putin himself signed off on it.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked a prominent Western businessman, who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with Sechin and other members of the Russian elite, about Page\u2019s claim to Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom on Sakhalin II, he said, \u201cI rolled my eyes at that one.\u201d (He, too, said he hadn\u2019t heard of Page until Trump\u2019s announcement.)\n\nFine. OK. Maybe Page exaggerated a bit on that one. But what about the reorganization and privatization of RAO UES, the Russian electricity giant? Maybe some of the Russians he worked with remembered a Carter Page?\n\nTurns out, they did.\n\n\u201cHis nickname was stranichkin,\u201d from the Russian word stranichka, or \u201clittle page,\u201d says Artem Torchinsky, who met Page during the breakup of RAO UES. Torchinsky, who was part of the company\u2019s financial department, worked alongside Page, who, at the time worked in Merrill Lynch\u2019s Moscow office. It was 2007, and Merrill Lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of RAO UES, and Torchinsky was resentful of Page and the other Merrill Lynchers: Torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and Page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. They were the fancy Western window dressing. \u201cIt really irritated our team,\u201d Torchinsky told me over Skype. \u201cWe worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and we\u2019d have to correct them. These guys didn\u2019t know what they were talking about.\u201d As for Page, \u201cHe made no impression whatsoever. Whether he was there or not, it made no difference,\u201d Torchinsky says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a pro, you see it. Page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.\u201d\n\nOK, harsh. But then I talked to Page\u2019s former boss, former Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko, who ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch for part of the time Page worked there. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t great and he wasn\u2019t terrible,\u201d Aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone \u201cwithout any special talents or accomplishments,\u201d someone who was \u201ca gray spot.\u201d \u201cWhat can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?\u201d he asked me.\n\nPage was a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like Merrill Lynch might have thousands of VPs. In the Moscow office, there were five ranks, and VP was right in the middle. In effect, it was \u201cjust the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom,\u201d says Aleksashenko.\n\nWhen it came to finance, Aleksashenko says, Page \u201cwas not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments.\u201d When it came to energy, Page and his team were, according to Torchinsky, \u201cmildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy.\u201d And, says Aleksashenko, \u201cjudging by the drivel he spews on Russia, you can tell he doesn\u2019t really understand the topic.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s putative adviser on Russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, \u201cdid not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy,\u201d says Aleksashenko.\n\n***\n\nFor the past few years, Page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. He has written columns in Global Policy Journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of Durham University. They are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. \u201cIn recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the United States after the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers in Missouri and New York respectively,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAlthough commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions.\u201d He is the kind of thinker who writes that Kanye West\u2019s \u201cNew Slaves\u201d and the \u201cartist\u2019s creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of U.S. foreign policy and world affairs\u201d but does it by opening with a citation from the Oxford English Dictionary (\u201cSlave; Pronunciation: /sl\u0101v/\u2026\u201d), roping in Adam Sandler, William F. Buckley and Dick Cheney.\n\nHis speech in Moscow\u2019s New Economic School was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word \u201cironically.\u201d \u201cFor the last 15 years, I\u2019ve been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it,\u201d he began. The video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldn\u2019t really speak Russian\u2014he had to have his questions translated for him into English. Except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, Vladimir Putin: \u201cWe never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. Unlike the USA.\u201d Which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing America abroad by citing Putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, Syria or Ukraine.\n\nPage also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he cut a strange figure. Like other Westerners doing business in Russia, Page took the view that Putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the West imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to Russia. But unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of Putin, people at the Council recall that Page was not particularly good at it. \u201cHe had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didn\u2019t really want to engage,\u201d one person from the Council says. His columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. \u201cThat blog post about the slaves. That\u2019s just \u2026 strange,\u201d says the Council member.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy, but of the people that I know that have Russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldn\u2019t be in the last decile, but he\u2019d be in the second-to-last decile,\u201d says one American executive with experience in Russia and its energy sector. \u201cYou\u2019d have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like Carter Page. I mean, wow.\u201d\n\n***\n\nI should\u2019ve just dropped the Carter Page story, but in the months since Trump named him an adviser, the campaign\u2019s Russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. Fancy Bear, who was probably a Russian hacker, broke into the Democratic National Committee emails, seemingly handed them over to Julian Assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. Trump\u2019s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort, flamed out in August because of his shady business dealings with the pro-Kremlin side of Ukraine, and Trump himself continues to say absurd things about Russia and Putin, like publicly inviting the Russian government to continue hacking American servers. Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode, and it was all I could do to stay on Page\u2019s trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign.\n\nI was not the only one. Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of Page\u2019s connections. Then there was Page, praising Putin. I found myself juggling two mutually contradictory Page narratives: Was Page, like Manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the West? This was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. Was Page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with China and Turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the Kremlin to influence the American election? Was he a man who, during a three-day trip to Moscow, met with two of Russia\u2019s most powerful men and was now being investigated for it?\n\nBut it was hard to see that man when I actually talked to people who knew him. Page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at Merrill Lynch\u2019s London and Moscow offices. Today, he claims he was cozy with Gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. \u201cNo one let him into Gazprom,\u201d Aleksashenko says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t go shake [Gazprom chief Alexey] Miller\u2019s hand. He made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in London.\u201d Another of Page\u2019s colleagues from Merrill Lynch confirmed that Page\u2019s role was simply arranging meetings between Gazprom and Western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. \u201cPeople organize meetings with Gazprom all the time,\u201d the former colleague said. \u201cHe hosted these guys in New York City but they would have done this 10 times a year\u2026 I used to do this; it doesn\u2019t require all that much skill. You just send out an email to 20 people saying Gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? The main thing is just getting those two [Gazprom] guys to agree. But because they agreed doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re close to him.\u201d\n\nBut the meetings did provide him with something else. \u201cGazprom didn\u2019t need money at the time,\u201d says the former colleague. \u201cThey were the most profitable company at the time. Their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. Their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. He was probably aware of that. He would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is.\u201d Page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies he\u2019s worked for to invest in them.\n\nAfter Merrill Lynch, Page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it Global Energy Capital. But he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. The fund is registered to his father\u2019s address in Poughkeepsie; Page listed himself as \u201cfounder and managing partner,\u201d even though the only other partner seemed to be Sergei Yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at Gazprom. He also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy Madison Avenue address\u2014that\u2019s the one \u201caround the corner from Trump Tower\u201d\u2014 which was actually the address of a co-working space.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Carter Page,\u201d says an American businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in Russia. \u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, he\u2019s been trying to throw together these deals. He\u2019s always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in Russia is done. I admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.\u201d\n\nIn the interest of due diligence, I also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that Russia\u2019s Alfa Bank paid for the trip as a favor to the Kremlin; that Page met with Sechin and Ivanov in Moscow; that he is now being investigated by the FBI for those meetings because Sechin and Ivanov were both sanctioned for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know this person,\u201d said Pyotr Aven, one of the two founders of Alfa Bank, which is considered the Western Russian bank. Aven and his partner, Mikhail Fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of Russia and have been quite critical of Putin. As for who paid for Page\u2019s trip, Aven was no less irritated by the question. \u201cI give them money, I don\u2019t know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, I have no idea,\u201d he said of the New Economic School, which hosted Page and of which Aven is the main benefactor. Exasperated by my questions, he snapped, \u201cDon\u2019t bring these Russian-style conspiracy theories to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are engaged in onanism,\u201d said Leontiev, the spokesman for Rosneft and Sechin when I asked him if Page had met with Sechin. \u201cIt\u2019s bullshit. Just bullshit. You need to understand who Sechin is to even ask this question. It\u2019s hard to have a meeting with him at all. It\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\nAs for the FBI investigation, well, it\u2019s unclear. A State Department official who works on Russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is \u201cno prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. Moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the FBI. OFAC runs them.\u201d He added, \u201cthe story doesn't add up.\u201d What does seem to have happened is that various U.S. intelligence agencies were looking into Page\u2019s time in Moscow, then briefed Senate minority leader, Democrat Harry Reid, who wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to investigate, among other things, \u201cwhether a Trump advisor who has been highly critical of U.S. and European economic sanctions on Russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in Russian energy conglomerate Gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow in July of 2016, well after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.\u201d\n\n***\n\nI got my next surprise when I called Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s senior adviser. I caught him just as the Trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: Who is Carter Page?\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d says Miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign.\n\n\u201cHe has no formal role in the campaign,\u201d Hope Hicks texted responding to my question.\n\nNow my interest was piqued. There were whispers all over Washington that, despite Hicks\u2019s denial, Page was not only still part of the Trump campaign, but its conduit for Russian influence. Was he?\n\nOne way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with.\n\nOne source suggested to me that Richard Burt, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, START treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for Alfa Bank, was the nexus. It was Burt who helped draft Trump\u2019s foreign policy speech in April, and had been advising the Trump campaign, via Senator Jeff Sessions, on foreign policy. But when I met Burt at his office at the McLarty Associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. \u201cThe only person I talked to about Carter Page is this guy at the Washington Post,\u201d Burt told me. \u201cAnd I told him I\u2019d never met the guy. Let me put it this way: if I have met him, I\u2019ve forgotten. He\u2019s the former Merrill Lynch guy, right?\u201d\n\nSomeone else told me that the Page connection was Rick Dearborn, Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, who hired Page because Dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for Trump\u2019s Alexandria, Virginia, policy shop and he happened to know Page. But Dearborn wouldn\u2019t return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither Dearborn nor Burt, but campaign co-chair Sam Clovis who recruited Page. \u201cIf he was part of that original group of people, I can say with 70 percent confidence it was Sam Clovis,\u201d this person told me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not answering your questions,\u201d Clovis told me. He refused to tell me if he was the one who found Page, but Jason Miller, the campaign\u2019s other spokesperson, says, \u201cCarter Page isn\u2019t someone I\u2019ve interacted with.\u201d Which confirmed what a policy staffer on the Trump campaign told me: \u201cCarter is a red herring, not a Rasputin. He\u2019s never met Trump, never briefed him. He has zero influence, none.\u201d\n\n***\n\nWas Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what Trump said\u2014he\u2019s my adviser\u2014and what his associates said\u2014\u201cWho?\u201d Maybe I wasn\u2019t doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the Russians were running, Page was firmly in the latter camp.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about his Russia fund, other than it\u2019s never really materialized,\u201d says the prominent player in the energy space whom Page has pitched on various energy projects. \u201cEvery conversation I\u2019ve had with Carter has not been terribly serious. They\u2019ve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. There are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities.\u201d He went on. \u201cI couldn\u2019t name a project that I could connect Carter\u2019s name to, any project that actually happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how he\u2019s earned a living off this,\u201d the energy player says, \u201cbut I think he\u2019s been trying to be an intermediary. If you hang around Russia long enough, it\u2019s sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.\u201d\n\nStrangely, it was not a Russian pinball that hit him; it was Trump. According to the Trump policy adviser, this winter, Clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. At a time when established Republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from Trump, \u201ca lot of people came to Sam Clovis in February, March, and said, \u2018I want to be part of the team,\u2019\u201d says the Trump adviser. And that\u2019s how it happened. \u201cHe\u2019s just a guy on a list. Trump looked at the list and said, \u2018He\u2019s an adviser.\u2019 And now he\u2019s milking it for all it\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\nNow, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a Very Important Person in Washington\u2014or at least could plausibly market himself as one. \u201cI was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, I had never heard of him,\u201d one Russia specialist in Washington told me. He saw Page at a Washington roundtable in June for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there \u201cin a way that someone who is junior would use it to network,\u201d but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listen\u2014and be impressed. \u201cHe was saying he was planning to go to Moscow,\u201d the Russia specialist recalls. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.\u201d\n\nAccording to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on Page\u2019s trip to Russia, \u201cthe meetings did happen and that\u2019s been established as a fact. I think the investigation is more what happened in them.\u201d But it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. \u201cIt\u2019s not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on?\u201d said the staffer. \u201cIs he acting as a conduit in ways that are against America\u2019s national security interests? Wittingly or un-, I should add. It\u2019s what\u2019s hard to parse about this. Is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a John le Carr\u00e9 novel? Or are they being played by much smarter people in the Kremlin?\u201d\n\nThis seems to be vintage Carter Page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. But he\u2019s also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really is\u2014and to try to turn a profit off of that. \u201cIf Page using his status as \u2018Trump advisor\u2019 for personal gain, that\u2019s another matter: Time for Page to join Twitter!\u201d Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. The Russians may be feeling out the Trump campaign via Page, but Page must be loving every minute of it. After all, meeting Russia\u2019s energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of Russian energy\u2014but the dream entered the realm of the possible when Trump said three words in March: \u201cCarter Page, Ph.D.\u201d Now Carter Page, Ph.D., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious Trump shark.\n\nFor months now, the American press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like Page and Manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether Putin is trying to destroy America by their hands, and is Trump a Kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference?\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be one in the world of Trump, which in some ways resembles Putin\u2019s: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. And that is all that matters. Is Putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of Western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? \u201cI want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of Russia,\u201d Putin says of the rumors of Russian meddling in the American election\u2014as we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think we\u2019ve finally grasped it.\n\nJulia Ioffe is contributing writer at Politico Magazine.",

        "text": "2016 Obama\u2019s team isn\u2019t laughing at Trump anymore The president\u2019s aides worry the Republican represents more of America than a fringe.\n\nObamaworld laughed as it watched Donald Trump\u2019s hostile takeover of the GOP. After eight years of Republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, President Barack Obama\u2019s aides, past and present, thought Republicans had gotten what they deserved--and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago.\n\nThey\u2019re not laughing anymore.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGoing into Monday night\u2019s debate, Obama\u2019s team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top Hillary Clinton aides: maybe the country isn\u2019t what they thought, maybe the resistance to Obamacare and gay marriage and the progress they\u2019re so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe they\u2019ve always dismissed. Maybe, the president\u2019s aides \u2013 current and former \u2013 now concede, they\u2019re going to have to live with the fact that Trump could end up in the Oval Office in part due to a backlash against Obama.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to think of a series to compare it to, which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama,\u201d said Ben LaBolt, a former White House aide and press secretary for Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re maybe in the fifth season of \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 here. We\u2019re way beyond the laughs, and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's not a lot of mirth in the circles I run in about him,\u201d said another former senior Obama campaign staffer.\n\nPrivately, Obama has expressed mixed feelings, according to people close to the president. He\u2019s still nursing amusement at Republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by Trump, but it\u2019s mixed with frustration that there are so many Americans he failed to reach. People who've spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people who\u2019ve benefited from his policies\u2014like those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of Obamacare\u2014support Democrats.\n\nFor Obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the president's climbing approval numbers, Trump\u2019s growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on \u2018hope.' Even if Clinton wins, the Republican has shown not only that America is divided between red and blue but that there\u2019s an America that Obama never connected with at all, and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as Monopoly money.\n\n\u201cWe are still the country that elected Barack Obama in 2008, and we are capable of that and more,\u201d said Jim Papa, a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the White House. \u201cBut we\u2019re also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. And that was even before he riled up Obama doubters again with his birther pirouette.\n\nAnd the result: Trump\u2019s doing better in the polls at this late stage than Obama\u2019s team imagined. With 43 days to go, Trump and Clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states.\n\nThough only a few weeks ago, current and former Obama aides would joke about how the president\u2019s great political legacy might be the Republican Party destroying itself in front of him. Now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion that Obama\u2019s legacy should be viewed in any frame that Trump also occupies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he thinks it\u2019s his legacy, I don\u2019t think any of us think it\u2019s his legacy,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. \u201cTrumpism is a lot of things in this country. President Obama is the face of that for some Republicans, but the Republican Party got themselves into this mess.\u201d\n\nBut they worry about what even a Trump loss says about Obama\u2019s America.\n\n\u201cI think he will lose badly in this election, but I think the impact he\u2019s had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting,\u201d said Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at Trump ended a year ago. \u201cHe\u2019s made us look stupid. I think he is stupid.\u201d\n\nFor any efforts Obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, \u201cTrump has shattered that,\u201d Vietor said. \u201cHe has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a low blow, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s not of substance. That\u2019s a bad lesson for people to learn.\u201d\n\nAccording to Earnest, Obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that he\u2019d had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. The sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense that it\u2019s not going away, despite their confidence in Clinton\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying we\u2019d all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the National Mall, but I am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts,\u201d said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign.\n\nNot everyone\u2019s inside Obamaworld is down. Some schadenfreude remains.\n\n\u201cHe's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the GOP, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure,\u201d said a more upbeat former Obama 2008 campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan.\n\nAnd Democrats\u2019 sense of the vacuous GOP that Trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the Republican nominee attack an economy that\u2019s gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble.\n\n\u201cThe eight-year legacy of the recovery from the Great Recession is clear evidence that the Tea Party movement,\u201d said Earnest, \u201cis intellectually bankrupt\u2014or about something other than the economy.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of American politics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather live in a world where the two parties really compete,\u201d Papa said, \u201cthan have a political edge on the Republican Party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.\u201d\n\nAuthors:",

        "text": "Off Message Is Donald Trump qualified to be president? In the most pivotal moment of 2016, these are the questions he must answer.\n\nH.L. Mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician \u2014 \u201cdown.\u201d\n\nLikewise, there\u2019s really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on Monday: as the first serious job interview for potential President Donald John Trump \u2014 an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of one-liners, faux familiarity and universal celebrity.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, it\u2019s a big night for Hillary Clinton too. She\u2019s got a lot to prove, for real, namely that she\u2019s not the lying, self-dealing crook many Americans think she is \u2014 or at least convince the 55 percent of voters who don\u2019t like her that her virtues (temperament and experience) compensate for decades of assorted ick. She needs to prove she can stand up to Trump, answer the usual email/foundation questions, convince whoever\u2019s still sellable on the idea (stop Instagramming a picture of your lunch, millennials, and listen up) that she\u2019s not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second John Roberts drops the swearing-in Bible.\n\nBut the spotlight belongs on Trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She\u2019s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples.\n\nEveryone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box \u2014 running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He\u2019s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn\u2019t read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn\u2019t read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can\u2019t even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.\n\nThese are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. They are facts based on reporting and Trump\u2019s own public performances. Here are five questions Trump needs to address on Monday \u2014 but taken together, they add up to one big one: Is Donald Trump qualified to be President of the United States?\n\n1. Does he actually know \u2014 or care to know \u2014 the basic information needed to competently run the country?\n\nOnly one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, and that\u2019s a candidate\u2019s capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. In recent days, Trump \u2014 who swooned after Clinton\u2019s superb convention in Philly \u2014 has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa since Aug. 1. He\u2019s still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although Clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. But he can win. Fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives Trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing.\n\nHis resurgence proves three political points \u2014 two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except Trump and his team: The country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, Clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and \u2014 lastly, but not leastly \u2014 Trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to.\n\nThe first debate should be a pivot \u2014 from politicking to president-ing. Being a cunning candidate isn\u2019t remotely the same thing as being ready to rule \u2014 and we should be moving to the Doris Kearns Goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. It probably won\u2019t happen, but a boy can dream.\n\nThis is not to suggest that Trump can\u2019t do the job (Ronald Reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), but he\u2019s been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence.\n\nTrump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs \u2014 apparently he wasn\u2019t aware Russia had annexed Crimea until George Stephanopoulos informed him recently. He obliterated Jeb Bush, that humbled patsy of the GOP establishment, in the debates \u2014 but Bush (if anyone had cared to listen) punctured Trump\u2019s bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on Chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by Beijing that could lead to a global depression. Trump wasn\u2019t aware of that fact, or just didn\u2019t care.\n\nThe caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. In April, I sat down with one of his longtime advisers, Roger Stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. \u201cAll you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not,\u201d said Stone, who has known the GOP nominee for decades. \u201cWhen you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. It's just too boring. Don't blame him; I don't like it either. So keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.\u201d\n\nStone argued that Trump isn\u2019t an ignoramus \u2014 just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. But George W. Bush\u2019s advisers, speaking to biographer Peter Baker, said that Bush\u2019s unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in Iraq. And during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, President Obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis.\n\nTrump\u2019s capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless \u2014 but there\u2019s not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job.\n\nMany Americans might not give a damn that he knows what HUD\u2019s Section 8 program is \u2014 and his failure to answer informational questions that Clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. But don\u2019t people have the right to know what he actually knows? Trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms \u2014 by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate?\n\n2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government?\n\nAgain, this is not a given. Hillary Clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. Trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in February, went so far as to say: \u201cWe're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace \u2026 we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a new one for a presidential nominee. As Corey Brettschneider wrote in POLITICO Magazine last month: \u201cFor more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with \u2018actual malice\u2019 \u2014 that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d\n\nDuring a private meeting with Hill Republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for \u201cArticle 12 of the Constitution.\u201d The framers stopped at seven. \u201cHe was just listing out numbers,\u201d said Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), a Trump backer at the time. \u201cI think he was confusing Articles and Amendments.\u201d\n\nOK, let\u2019s write that one off as a gotcha \u2014 you can understand Constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. But consider his reaction to the Paris bombings last November when Trump told FOX News he thought the government should shutter some mosques where \u201csome bad things are happening.\u201d The comment was decried by Constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the \u201cFree Exercise\u201d clause of the First Amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds.\n\n3. Why won\u2019t Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts?\n\nHillary Clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs \u2014 and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. And serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism.\n\nBut the Clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and Trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one.\n\nWhy does it matter? Because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that Clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the White House, Senate and State Department. At issue is Trump\u2019s fundamental personal narrative, and his claim that he\u2019s \u201cvery, very rich.\u201d He is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he says he\u2019s good for $11 billion; Forbes and other outlets say he\u2019s worth less than half that much).\n\nMore serious is the issue of Trump\u2019s debts: The Clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in China and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. If that\u2019s a lie, there\u2019s an easy way to prove it \u2014 by releasing the returns.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a liberal media witch-hunt: Many Republicans, including supporters like House Speaker Paul Ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast.\n\n4. What\u2019s the deal with his charitable foundation? Then there\u2019s the matter of Trump\u2019s sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. In expos\u00e9 after expos\u00e9, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees for Trump\u2019s businesses and sports memorabilia) that Trump himself has conceded might be illegal.\n\nThe problem, yet again, is that Trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of Fahrenthold and others.\n\n5. Why lie? These days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. If presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at Hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system.\n\nBut if Trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statements he\u2019s made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts.\n\nHillary Clinton (\u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d in Trump\u2019s parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint \u2014 far from it \u2014 and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of GOP congressional investigators.\n\nBut it\u2019s a crowning irony of 2016 that the Republican Party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness \u2014 especially George W. Bush\u2019s claims about Iraq \u2014 would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (A recitation of Trump\u2019s whoppers would take up too much space \u2013 read POLITICO\u2019s comprehensive \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and Half-Truths\u201d for a taste.)\n\nIn an attempt to defend Trump, buddy Newt Gingrich, who lobbied to be Trump\u2019s running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. \u201cClinton,\u201d the former speaker wrote, \u201cis a fox who knows many things you can fact check. Trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing\u2026\u201d\n\nBut getting the facts right \u2014 and telling the truth \u2014 is a big thing. It\u2019s the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.\n\nAuthors:",
